Most of the stuff on the browser is going to use rest apis but the player obviously can't, since it's streaming data.

Python,"I guess I am not sure of the value-add in that case.  Right now I run a `build.py` script that I made that generates a docker image tarball, a `.spec` file, cleans up the filesystem, then builds the solution via PyInstaller.  This delivers an executable that is essentially a portable Python with all deps; users can run it and see the output, interact, etc.  


I am not sure where something like this fits in: it would make my life harder, and it would not make my users life any easier.   Congrats on the project, seeing something through all the way is more than I can muster sometimes.  Perhaps targetting *either* delivery OR consumption (but not both) would make this more useful.",3

Python,I would have loved finding something like this on someone’s system back when I was a pen tester,2
Python,3.14 is also an approximation. And 22/7 is more accurate.,3
Python,"I use Django, Flask, and FastAPI at work in my production applications.  They all have their own strengths and weaknesses.  I like SQLAlchemy more than Django's ORM - I feel the low level and core interfaces make working with bulk data much easier than with django - and if you know how alembic works it's great too once you pick it up.  I have automated database migration pipelines using both and have had very little trouble with them.

Django has a lot of gotchas, the Middleware and plug-in system can slow things way down if you are using many of them and the memory footprint can be really big if you arent trimming down the runtime by disabling unused components.  That said, a stripped down Django instance behind a webserver like Bjoern performs fairly well if you can afford the bloat.",1
Python,"Why not just put python scripts in users’ $PATH, chmod +x them, and add a shebang at the top with a venv or the system Python with the packages installed? Then they don’t have to search for scripts at all and they also don’t have to open a GUI to run a Python script",4

Python,Pyinstaller alteady exists,5
Python,Lotta Nazis on your site...,1
Python,"The function isn't global lol. It is assigned in a constructor to every instance of the class, and the function is scoped to where it is defined. You can easily prove this.

    >>> class Foo: pass
    >>> a = Foo()
    >>> b = Foo()
    >>> c = Foo()
    >>> s1 = weakref.WeakSet([a, b, c])
    >>> s2 = weakref.WeakSet([a, b, c])
    >>> s1._remove is s2._remove
    False
    >>> type(s1._remove)
    <class 'function'>
    >>> id(s1._remove)
    525025649952
    >>> id(s2._remove)
    525025782944

No globally accessible function exists here that exploits storing mutable state. Only an internally defined local function. An attribute on an object to a function defined locally within another function is not a globally accessible function.

Furthermore the weakref itself isn't mutated on the function signature. The object that owns the method is mutated, which is the object that creates the reference in the first place, so it is totally irrelevant. No mutable data is stored on the function.

TL;DR the example is irrelevant to my point.

You seem to be struggling to actually understand what is a very simple point, and your condescending tone seems to suggest you are getting very upset that you cant wrap your head around this. It is advanced stuff though so it is understandable.",1
Python,"Not sure if you understand what my project is? It strays away from the Web API. Whatever you can do as a regular user, you can do with my wrapper.",1
Python,"let me give you more context why i built this. in my workplace people run python scripts manually for  some tasks. they are not programmer. very agile code expect for package and versions, they remain more or less the same. so had to install and manage on many systems. sometimes something changes in path and it breaks. also people had hard time navigating to script to run via terminal, not much standard was set.",0
Python,"Here's a brief (too brief, honestly) description of optional dependencies: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/#dependencies-and-requirements

But the best way to learn about how to do more complex packaging is to find a few libraries on github and see how they do it. For example, fastapi has many optional deps. https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/blob/master/pyproject.toml

You'll want to look at how they handle imports for optional dependencies, so that you can gracefully tell your user that they need to install the package with the right extras in order to use that functionality.

I do think that the recommendation (or at least option) to provide a token for authentication is a good idea. My most recent passion project has an example of this, there are multiple ways for a user to authenticate. https://github.com/NodeJSmith/otf-api/blob/2c02c1fe6ecc3952e3a501997270cd6f904a90f9/src/otf_api/api.py#L69

As far as hatch, I would recommend going slow on tools like poetry, hatch, flit, etc. There are quite a few, only poetry has been around long enough to be confident it will remain, and they all have their own opinionated way of doing things. You don't need any of them right now (or ever, really) so I would hold off on that rabbit hole",1
Python,"Function globals the thing I wrote. Refers to the functions globals dictionary. AKA you have no idea what I am talking about and do not understand the topic. Also the closure doesnt hold reference to the object either in this class because there is no actual name tracing that goes backout. The self in the inline defined function does not reference the external part. So there is no vars in the closure that are bound to the lifetime of the inner function and those references can drop. That is explicitly important. 

If it returned a function bound to the instance as you are erroneously claiming when that function is given to a ref object as a callback the function Weakset from GC'ing. 

Explicitly the goal is to NOT BIND THE FUNCTION TO THE INSTANCE. 

Thank you for confirming you do not know anything about these libraries and the reasons it is needed to do this stuff. Its an advanced feature I can see why you would be unfamiliar with it.",0
Python,Just a heads up that the player is difficult to implement and you do have to have a premium account for that. https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui?tab=readme-ov-file#limitations,1
Python,"shame it assumes a function bound by a closure is global when it isn't a global function, it is bound to an instance and returns a function bound to that instance, which is totally different and unrelated to what I am talking about.",0
Python,"Private methods are just a convention - nothing is truly private in Python. Naming something with an underscore prefix tells someone using your library that they shouldn't depend on that function not changing, as it's not part of the public api. That's all that the single underscore does.

The double underscore actually changes how the python interpreter structures your code. It introduces name mangling https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/name-mangling-in-python/ and changes how the attribute or function can actually be accessed. It has its place, but your library doesn't need it (99% of python projects don't need it).

As far as making it so instances can't access them, no, that's not a thing. If it's an instance method like __do_follow then your instance method can access it (your code wouldn't work if it couldn't) using self, just like any other method. However, a user of your library can't access the method outside of the class instance, unless they prefix the name with the class name - the link explains this much more clearly. But basically, you don't want to use that, when it does eventually bite you it will be a pain in the ass with no benefit. 

The bit about saving the session to avoid redoing the captcha makes sense. I would still recommend having a single way of doing this in the standard package and then having package extras for additional ways of saving the session. It's a good learning opportunity and it keeps the base package slimmer.

You certainly don't have to use a pyproject.toml, but most modern simple packages do. I usually see setup.py being used for more complex libraries that do things like build C extensions, like pandas https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/setup.py.",1
Python,uhmm so basically pyinstaller exe with more steps or is my dumbass missing something here?,2
Python,"Two features that would be golden on this (kick ass), ability to get stdin from the runner window, and support for colored/ANSI logging, and build in scripts (presets).",0
Python,"I think this is amazing. Often at work there are instances where I want to make one-off scripts for other people but its hard to get 5 minutes on their machine to set up python/venv so they can run it. And using pyinstaller is cool but it needs a lot of boilerplate setup, and its never enough because the lack of msi/setup tools. Dont get me started with windows defender crapping all over “one-file” mode.

Just getting a python runner their machine and they can run the one-off scripts from the shared drive is amazing.",-4
Python,"only way I learned to tackle the problems was feeding error codes to gpt and instead of asking for a fix, i asked what the error means, it implications and possible ways to start solving it.

gpt is amazing with providing general information on specific issues.",1
Python,"Judging from his [Twitter bio](https://x.com/gvanrossum), I'd think that he is probably in support of Tim's suspension.",1
Python,"Apples and oranges. Django is a framework, fastapi is a library.   You build your whole project from start on Django, while fastapi is merely a library you integrate in your project, way less opinionated.",2

Python,Don’t include optional dependencies or dependencies of dependencies in requirements.txt. That file should include only the packages necessary to run your scripts.,11
Python,"What’s the difference between this and running `python myscript.py` in a command line?

Also, you made it windows-only and I honestly can’t see a reason why, other than using windows path objects?",4
Python,I was thinking about that too.  Right now I have a store per entity type which would not work for joins since the data is separate.  but maybe you can have a store contain multiple entity types and define a join operation as part of the ORM.  Join could take in something like join key and filters.,1

That's exactly how it works. That's what makes api stateful rather than stateless. If the result of one of your calls depends on the previous calls, that's stateful interaction. In this case the result of ""submit review"" depends on whether or not ""upload image"" was previously called.

Python,"Django is for use when you know you want a tank and ammunition. It is inappropriate to invest in a tank if you are going to then spend time stripping it down removing all the stuff you don't want.

FastAPI is for use when you need a chassis and wheels, and have the capability of building and maintaining what you need on that chassis. It is not appropriate if you need caterpillar tracks, a turret, 100 depleted uranium shells, radar, a full encrypted radio system, and GPS out of the box. If you know what you do need though and are willing to set it up, you get a result which is more likely to cover exactly what you need.

It really depends what you need, how big it is, how generic it is, whether you care about cost (which I use as a metaphor for how much maintenance it needs, how big it is, and how fast it is).

Every programming language has this trade off with frameworks. In Java (since I am a Java software engineer, so that is the example you will get from me) you can go down the Spring Boot route with full ORM, metrics, logging, dependency injection, tracing, configuration parsing, cloud integration, etc. Or you can go down the route of setting up servlets or netty manually and only adding what you need.",4

An application that adheres to the [REST architectural constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST#Architectural_constraints) may be informally described as *RESTful*

And further down:

>The formal REST constraints are as follows:[^(\[9\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST#cite_note-9)

>\* Client/Server - Client are separated from servers by a well-defined interface

>***\* Stateless - A specific client does not consume server storage when it is ""at rest""***

>\* Cache - Responses indicate their own cacheability

>\* Uniform interface

>\* Layered system - A client cannot ordinarily tell whether it is connected directly to the end server, or to an intermediary along the way

>\* Code on demand (optional) - Servers are able to temporarily extend or customize the functionality of a client by transferring logic to the client that can be executed within a standard virtual machine",-9

If I have a separate use case that just lists all of the categories, I'll surely need a separate FakeCategoryRepository to test it, but that's going to be completely separate to the FakeItemRepository. Maybe it doesn't matter?

Python,"I have used [`sly`](https://github.com/dabeaz/sly), which is based on [`ply`](https://github.com/dabeaz/ply). Both should be great. I took David Beazley's compilers course, which, at the time, involved using `sly` to make an interpreter and compiler. I would highly recommend the course, though I can't be sure if he's still using `sly` in the course today.

See also David's talk on [reinventing the parser generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ9z6Ge-vXs).

Python,"For ORM if needed there could be a layer where ORM object are cast onto ""simpler"" objects so that so you can use them later in the code without subsequent queries or problems with database session state. That could be done with dataclasses. 

So there could be a repository that fetches data from the model and returns given dataclass objects instead of the SQALchemy ones for example. Stores on top of that are less likely to be useful - the repository already returns requested objects (and generators have some advantages if needed).",1

Python,First ever library so go easy but how do I do an optional requirement? I will update readme today to include a way to do without the captcha solver. I’ve heard different things about implicit booleans and I personally prefer explicit because it strips the methods if it’s an improper type (i.e NoneType). I’ve used implicit booleans in the past but heard it was bad practice 🤷‍♂️,2
Python,"Thanks for the well written feedback.

- I thought private methods were used so instances can’t access them?
- Well the point is that Captcha costs money and it saves time as you can just save the cookies and load them after logging in once (You can also dump cookies into the session so you can login manually without a captcha solver)
- I seen the .toml but thought it was just an alternative method to it. Will look into it.
- I thought I wrote a requirements section but maybe it got deleted (still new to git) but I do plan on getting rid of the captcha by moving over to the mobile API (Protobuf will be a pain though)
- Thank you very much 🙏",3
Python,"Using `or` might trigger unwanted behavior in some scenarios. For example:

```
def add_to_list(x, some_list = None):
    some_list = some_list or []
    some_list.append(x)
    return some_list
```

And now notice that:

```
lst = []
add_to_list(5, lst)

But after the above code, `lst` will still be empty, because `bool([])` evaluates to `False`.",1
Python,"The schedule shows 3.14 alpha 6 planned for US π day, and candidate 1 for European π day (22/07).",37
Python,"That pymongo requirement is dumb, it should be an extra (optional requirement) at most. Why would someone want to use mongodb for this?

Since you target developers, ""extract the token from the browser"" would most likely be a nicer option than ""enter username and password and use some cloud service to crack the captcha"".

I spotted at least one `len(foo) == 0` which is considered unpythonic - just do `not foo` instead.

`if not (""success"" in resp.response):` is worse. Python has a `not in` operator so change that to `if 'success' not in resp.response:`

Get rid of that setup.py, and add a pyproject.toml (`hatchling` would be a good choice for the build backend): https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/",0

Kidding of course, congrats and welcome to one of the easiest languages to be productive in, truly productive.",2
Python,"It's an interesting concept, I actually had a need for something like this recently but ended up just registering with a dev account.

Couple of thoughts:

- I'd recommend not naming your private methods with double underscores - that introduces name mangling which you don't need and the standard convention is a single underscore

- I'm not sure I see the point of the session savers, they look like they may be a solution in search of a problem. I get this is for education so maybe that's the whole purpose but it introduces a lot of extra requirements that end users may not want to deal with. I'd at least make them optional, which could be a good learning experience in itself.

- setup.py isn't the recommended way of packaging projects anymore, the most modern way is pyproject.toml (I think, python packaging really is a headache) - this isn't that big of a deal in the long run, but wanted to point it out

- the Readme makes it sound very simple but there is no mention of the captcha solver and what it takes to get an api key for that, which seems a bit disingenuous.

- great job with the type annotations and code organization, this was actually a treat to read through 👌",10

Instead, a certain ideological group has managed to gain majority control and has been using their majority to give themselves more power.

Now that they're going so far as to ban one of *the* most important contributors to the project for trumped up reasons, their motivations are becoming more clear.

They're long, so the committee here is counting on most people not reading it; but after doing so, the conclusion is clear.

There are also potentially cases where you might have a default be some globally used singleton object, which may be intended to be mutable.  Eg. something like: `def register(obj, registry=toplevel_registry)`.  Or `def print(text, file=sys.stdout)`",1

While Python is incredibly versatile and can be used for a wide range of tasks, it's not necessarily the best tool for every job.

Additionally, Python's dynamic typing, while powerful, can sometimes lead to unexpected bugs that are difficult to track down.

That said, Python's strengths - its readability, vast ecosystem of libraries, and ease of use - often outweigh these drawbacks, especially for rapid prototyping, data analysis, and backend development.

Python,You could also do (a or []).copy() if you don’t like the two additional lines of checking for None…,3
Python,"So as someone with decades of experience in the industry, here's the deal.

First, it's important to have deep knowledge about some subjects. Two years experience with Django means you're definitely experienced, but maybe not deep yet. If you can't build a production-class, complex Django project from scratch while employing best practices, then you aren't deep yet, and your career would be better served by continuing to focus on building new Django projects for a few more years.

Second, it's important to have broad experience in addition to deep. Having experience with mobile app development is definitely a good thing, it will make you a better developer overall, and will ultimately make you a better back-end developer. Having broad experience generally also makes it easier to find jobs in the future, especially if you don't let your old skills get too rusty. If you had a few more years of Django under your belt, it would sound like a great opportunity.

Third, it's not your employer's job to guide your career, it's yours. Your employer will put you wherever it's convenient and efficient for them, even if that is potentially a career dead-end for you. What I will say is that, wherever you are, what's most important is to be doing new development, and if your current employer doesn't have that opportunity in the area you want, then it's time to start looking for a new employer. But that in no way means your decision to jump at the opportunity to lean iOS development is a bad one.

Is iOS development a career dead-end? I doubt it. Is it a better gig than Django development? Only you can say. But based on where things stand, here's what I'd say you should do:

* Tell your boss that you're looking forward to learning iOS, but that you're concerned about losing what you've learned about Django, because that's where your primary interest is. Make clear that if there is an opportunity to jump back to back-end development at some point, you want to be first in line. In the meantime, you should be staying in touch with your back-end coworkers to see if opportunities may be opening up, and watching your employer's job postings for anything back-end related (don't rely on your employer alone to tell you; once they have you trained in iOS dev that may not want you to leave).

* Dive into iOS development and learn as much as you can, as fast as you can. Give it six months before you decide if you love it or hate it. If you decide that it's not your cup of tea, or that it doesn't have good long-term career prospects, and there are still no back-end projects for you at your employer, then you need to start looking for a new employer that has back-end Django development. By that point, you'll be an experienced back-end developer with mobile experience, so possibly even more valuable for the right company.

One more note. It's important to ask yourself a tough question: does your company _really_ not have new Python, or has someone decided that you're not that strong in Python and so they are giving you another opportunity. If there are no new Python projects, what are all your back-end colleagues going to be doing?",0

My initial preference would be a ResNet here since you only have one bounding box.

Then train a ResNet on the cropped bounding boxes to predict the MRZ, this string can be encoded as a one hot vector for each character. Or if the MRZ code has variable sized output, you can train the resnet as a feature extractor (ie only use the first half of the resnet model) and have an output block be a variation of an LSTM for variable output. 

You could even only train a single ResNet that takes in the whole image and just outputs a prediction MRZ, but it's usually more accurate to split up the task

Python,"> Have a bad time writing anything beyond basic Python

I respectfully disagree, and would request we keep the responses respectful and not condescending in tone.

Globally defined functions being bound to global **mutable** state is a code smell. It is difficult to consistently test, due to it having side effects which can depend on how other tests have interacted with the function and thus how the tests are ordered. This is not scalable, maintainable, or thread safe.

Wrap behaviour in a class that you can maintain unique scoped instances of, and can control. It is a little more code but it will ensure you don't have to rewrite dozens of call sites in the future when you realise a single global state is not what you want. It also shows that it was intentional and not a developer induced bug.

Citing how standard library internals work as the thing that dictates good Python code is a poor argument. The standard library operates on what is often a lower level due to the interaction with underlying C modules. That aside, it is defining many of the ""primitives"" that you use in your code and thus should not need to be replicating. Furthermore the standard library makes numerous decisions with regards to convention and code style and naming practises that are commonly cited as bad practise and/or confusing.

> Weakref does it

No. Weakref uses default argument values, but they are not mutable. My argument is about mutable default arguments only. https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Lib/weakref.py. Most of the underlying implementation comes from a C module which is not object oriented so applying the object oriented/functional purity argument for using objects with mutable state rather than functions with mutable default parameters is a bit pointless here. 

Using the argument that the standard lib does it when you are not implementing things for the standard lib is also somewhat of an odd argument. 

> Cache methods use it

https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Lib/functools.py#L495 again, false. They use immutable values in default arguments. I have no problem with this. I have no problem with _replacing_ a function definition with a mutable object either. My problem is with allowing mutable parameter defaults when it is almost always NOT what people want to do and if they do want to implement it, they can use an object decorating it rather than fiddling with the function definition itself.

> Have a bad time writing beyond basic python

If you are relying on mutable default arguments to be able to write basic python, then that probably should be considered concerning as it almost certainly means your code will have side effects that are hard to test and hard to reason with.

There is a reason most respectful linters actively advise against this practise (see PyLint W0102 dangerous-default-value as an example).

There is an entire thread discussing alternatives at  https://discuss.python.org/t/revisit-mutable-default-arguments/37525 for this reason.

Like literally you need the effect to deal with function globals that need to be bound to the lifetime of the function. 

Straight up I think nearly everything in the WeakRef lib uses some form of strong bound arguments abuse. I think most cache methods also do this. Without this you would end up binding your Weak containers to the lifetime of the objects stored in them because of how weak references store their callable.  

It is not a looks cool, it is a mainstream feature of the language. This isn't the only place it crops up, class namespace also has this stuff buried in it. You need to get comfortable with it existing or you are going to have a bad time writing anything beyond basic python.",-11

Python,"It's awesome to hear that Python has opened up a new world for you! There’s something incredibly satisfying about the mix of logic and creativity in coding, especially when your day-to-day is all about rigid data and processes. Python is such a perfect language for getting started too—it’s like the gateway drug to coding because of how intuitive and versatile it is. 



And you're definitely not alone! A lot of people from non-CS backgrounds dive into programming and find it’s this hidden passion they never knew they had. Whether it’s automating boring tasks, analyzing data, or just solving little puzzles, coding can feel like a superpower. Keep at it, and who knows where it’ll take you next!",2
Python,"Any cases where it is useful are code smells and can be implemented properly via other means.

IMO CPython should enforce an immutable wrapper or frozen marker on arguments implicitly to prevent the chance of this happening. Something similar to freeze in Ruby.

Python,Great work. Keep it up. But where do you get gmail API?,1
Python,"But don't. If you wanted something like that, and couldn't use `functools.cache` as mentioned, you can make a class pretend to be a function:

I only know of specific Python packages for radiology images and genetics, but beyond that you might be looking at more general tools.

If you have a specific project in mind then that’s actually easier- it will give you a target and the focus required to get there.

If you just want to learn, find an interesting project to get you going. Perhaps aim for a particular field- get started with a web framework like flask or Django to support browser-based projects, or GUI frameworks for computer-based apps.

You may not have a huge amount of time as an R1 - it’s important to be realistic about what you can do in that time and not to be discouraged. If you find yourself advancing super quickly, please do look up from the computer and check up on your _main_ career.

Python,"Well I've only been at it for a month or so now and still trying to figure things out so I'm not quite that far as of yet. 

But so far I've just made a couple simple scripts, based around automation. I'm currently building an organization page that collates and organizes all of our servers into one web page. It takes in a CSV file and connects to each ilo, grabs the necessary data, and generates an HTML webpage. 

There is also a backup function I'm adding to it that will save license keys/serial numbers to a spreadsheet for us to have a backup of in the event of a server failure.

I'm sure applications like this exist already, but I'm creating a custom thing for the experience and practice.

The big project I want to be able to do involves gathering info from all of our servers and updating our central CMDB so that its got all of the correct information.

As I said, I'm still quite new to it so much of my code is probably quite simple, but considering this time a month ago I wouldn't have had a clue what to do I think I'm making pretty good progress.",2

It almost comes across as “Person brings up how changing rules could lead to abuse of power. Gets temporary ban.”",2
Python,"So rather than take a single filename, it expects a function to output a filename instead. The thinking is you probably want your filename to be datetime stamped, or randomised somewhat, otherwise every new debug dump would overwrite the last one. My example would just save over the exception each time since it's a pure function.",1
Python,"I'm pretty sure the concept you're seeking is called ""uv mapping"", or is at least adjacent to it.


Basically imagine you have a 2d gradient where the colors of each pixel coordinate correspond to its location. Black is at 0, 0, 0. Red is at 255, 0, 0. Green is at 0, 255, 0, Yellow is at 255, 255, 0.


You then write some program that translates the color coordinate into a corresponding coordinate of the texture you're trying to warp. 0, 0, 0 maps to 0, 0. 255, 0, 0 maps to `max_image_width`, 0, 0. 0, 255, 0 maps to 0, `max_image_height`, 0. 255, 255, 0 maps to `max_image_width`,  `max_image_height`, 0. Something halfway between black and red gets mapped to `max_image_width * .5`, 0, 0, and similar patterns follow for all other color coordinates.


I'm probably explaining it badly; I'm no graphics programmer, but that's at least part if the puzzle you want to solve.",2
Python,"If Python is something that you \*must\* use, then my suggestion would be use as many high-performance packages as possible. These packages have C- or Rust-bindings to do the 'heavy' part in a lower-level language. Take Pydantic for example for data validation. When they moved from pure-Python to Rust-bindings for the core functionality, their performance went 5-fold (as in, 5 times as fast). Another example of such a high performance package is the well-known Numpy package.

Python,[https://docs.exaloop.io/codon?](https://docs.exaloop.io/codon),1
Python,This is a very valid approach. I will think about it! ,2
Python,"I believe you are very correct. After all if best practices were really that important, we would not be using python (in a setting it is not meant to be used and trying to force  workarounds) but C++. I will most likely defend the opinion that we should either do C++ with OOP or drop the future maintainability (premature optimisation, anyone?) and write Python and numba the numba way. ",3
Python,"> We are trying to find a balance between good coding practices, code quality and speed. 

I'm making some assumptions here based on the way you've phrased this and talked about OOP, but I suspect you'll do better if you worry less about good coding practices, and concentrate more on just getting the project to work.

I'm a software developer by training, but for a while, I worked with scientists as a kind of consultant/trainer for their software work.  They'd write the code they needed for their project, and then we'd come in and provide advice on how to get that code into a maintainable state that others could use, or that could be published in journals etc.

A lot of that code was bad (understandably so: writing maintainable software is hard, and not the primary goal of most scientists).  But in my experience, a lot of the most complicated code to understand came from people who worried a lot about best practices when coding — they would use lots of OOP, indirection, DRY, etc, but because they weren't necessarily experienced enough to use those tools well, they made things harder to understand, not easier.

Admittedly, I don't have a huge amount of experience with high-performance calculations in Python.  But I suspect that using Numba and doing things the ""Numba way"", even if that involves writing fewer classes and leaving your data in a more raw form, will produce easier-to-read and easier-to-maintain code than going down the Cython route with classes.  Concentrate on getting the code to work (where ""work"" means ""it does what it needs to do, and it does it fast enough""), then worry about maintainability after that.",5

Python,"Could I make a dumb suggestion. You said the computations take hours, but in numba it's down to minutes.

How about you convert the dynamic data structures and virtual methods to a static data structure (arrays) first, and virtual methods to functions (probably). And then you process the whole lot as a batch in separate code in numba or numpy. And then you convert the processed data back to a dynamic data structure. 

just imagine your python program does all the dynamic stuff to generate a file with all data, then the data gets handed over to an optimized external program that doesn't need to care about oop, perform all the computations,  and then the data goes back to python where it is converted back to oop structures.",1

There are different audio-related packages available for python, which all of them and I repeat, all of them are simply wrappers for audio libraries that are in C such as pyfmodex for Fmod. This would be alright if these packages were maintained well enough to keep up with the updates to the C library, but unfortunately this is not the case as python users don't directly play with audio so when you use these libraries, you'll either face a lack of documentation, or a lot of errors that you need to fix in the package by yourself to get things to work as expected.",1

Python,"Great !! This sounds cool , I was trying to make something similar with python",1
Python,"I think Cython could work. But you should know what you are doing, and you should know what Cython does.

If you just compile normal Python code as Cython, you don't get much of a performance improvement. To see any substantial improvement you'll have to move parts of your code to Cython with `cdef` and static typing. `cdef` definitions aren't Python anymore, these are things that compile directly to C. Basically that's what you want if you want to improve performance.

Now you need to consider whether your inner loops can be easily implemented in pure Cython, *without accessing Python structures*. Cython code can look things up in Python dictionaries and whatnot - run normal Python code - but it does so at Python speed. If you can cleanly separate your bottleneck from Python objects and do the simulation in pure (or mostly pure) Cython, that's when you'll see large performance gains.

Another point - I've seen in the past that replacing a Python class with a Cython `cdef class` reduces instantiation time and memory overhead. If you're creating billions of tiny Python objects, it's worth considering. I see that these days there's a decorator called `cython.cclass`. I'd give it a try.",3

Python,"Sir, Even though at moments like this I would love to put pg++ features on the table, I'm not able to because the program is such on an early stage of development, that certainly there is a lack of key features or 'identity' however on the official documentation you can find the official [roadmap](https://github.com/DliberttiGroup/pygit-pp/blob/main/DOCS/roadmap.md) where I have features that should come in the next one week or two and if you allow me let me tell you the unofficial ones.

# Future keys Features that are planned on the unofficial roadmap

* **Both full TUI and web based GUI:**

This is so the user can have a full graphical environment to work with their repo however it will never be a requirement for them to start one of those graphical environments to have full access to full features

* **A daemon, with an API for plugins:**

A daemon that will run locally on a thread of the user when pg++ is running this is so to expose a API that will be used as a plugin system for pg++ fully compatible with other languages such as: js, go, rust, zig

* **Fully Customizable:**

Right now a very basic config system is being implemented the unofficial plan is to expand that system to make it able for the user to basically personalize a lot of aspect of how pg++ runs.

This are just some of the ideas among other such as a hook system, yes it is right they are just ideas right now, however I'm planning to work on them, because I think it will be just freaking cool to have a tool like that.

* **Dependencies:** At the moment pg++ only uses 4 dependencies. (not counting `pyinstaller` which is only to compile the code into a binary) Plus there are no plans of adding more external dependencies in the near future.
* **Runtime:** Even though we can say python is not fast as C++ or zig, pg++ has demonstrated a time good time bench at runtime.

Python,"All the good parts mentioned are true - here are the bad parts.

It means you are essentially writing in two languages, Python and Cython. To get decent performance you have to rewrite your Python code in Cython.

Now you have a whole compile/link phase in your workflow. No fun.

How do you debug this code? Big can of worms here - you're debugging compiled C code, and not particularly nice C code.

If you make a mistake in your Cython, your program can crash, and I don't mean with a traceback but a core dump.

(And you then have to deploy this compiled blob, which is non-trivial, particularly if it uses shared libraries, but this is probably a one-time chore for some sucker.)

You aren't giving us a clear enough picture of your application to make specific recommendations but...

> a mix of functions and index mapped arrays which is now spaghetti

So it is doable. The trouble is that you didn't architect the code properly.

There is nothing that you can do with OOP, inheritance and polymorphism that you can't do with functions and index mapped arrays _with the same or very similar syntax for the programmer_ with some clever use of Python.

I'd look at numpy, pytorch, or perhaps numba, systems which are designed to do massively parallel computations, and even take advantage of GPUs and other hardware, and try to rearrange your mind to think of these systems as primary, and your programmer's API on top of that.

> breaking most of the SOLID principles and doing hacky workarounds. 

OOP and SOLID are strong, but should not be handcuffs, particularly in this case where they seem to be preventing you from getting the job done. [Mixins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin), for example, can be extremely disciplined if used thoughtfully, but aren't OOP and break most of SOLID.

I suggest you worry less about SOLID and more about an elegant API for your programmers on top of numpy or pytorch.",1
Python,"Hm. I don't want to be rude, as I've wished with high computational heavy code in Python and have wrote C++ based libraries to get more performance in it with Boost.

Do yourself a favour and use as little chatGPT as possible, ideally not at all. It's mostly providing wrong code and logic (at least for finance, which is all I really know). See for example https://quant.stackexchange.com/q/76788/54838",1

        if item < some_value:
            unmarked.append(item)

This code select the items from an array that meet certain criteria using a loop, simple enough. 

    items_list = np.array(items_list)
    indices = np.where(items_list < some_value)
    unmarked = items_list[indices]

And now we do the same thing without any loops involved. The only thing that varies is the type of the **unmarked** array, that is a Python list in the first example and a NDArray in the second example. But converting from one type to the other, if you need it, is simple.

When you're working in the order of millions of iterations, the boost in speed of replacing each loop with an operation over a numpy array, is quite noticeable. And when you have nested loops, if you can find a way to turn those computations into matrix operations with 2D or 3D numpy arrays, the gain in speed is also huge.",4

Python,I started a bootcamp off of udemy about a month ago and I'm now in the process of making a bunch of automation scripts for work. I started it because I had to support some apps at work and I'm rather enjoying it. Its taking me a bit to wrap my head around all of the concepts but I'm sure I'll get it with time and practice.,9
Python,Thank you! That is new to me and I will check it out!,2
Python,"I see. Thank you, I will keep this in mind!",1
Python,Unfortunately the loops are not so simple. A lot of math does happen inside them but also a lot of cross interaction of different class instances across more complex data structures. Im not sure that can be vectorized as each iteration is directly affected by the one before it.,2
Python,Thank you so much,3
Python,I will give cython a try in the coming days and update with the progress :) ,1
Python,You are completely correct. We are interested in performance first and maintainability second. Im trying to see if we can habe best of both worlds without adding the complexity of a new language but this seems hardly possible at this time.,1
Python,Agreed that PyPy is a better first step. Especially if loops are the bottleneck!,3
Python,"I only really hacked the project together over the last couple of days, so haven't considered it till now- it would definitely be awesome though!",1
Python,not a chance,11
Python,"Just start chunking away at the project you want to work on.

Start by outlining your idea. What’s the flow? What’s the end product look like? 

Once you’ve got that down, break it into parts.

I get stuff here.
I do calculations on the stuff above
I print out projections for x, y, and z years.

Whatever it ends up being. Once you’ve got that, start thinking about what you need to do to accomplish each step.

“I want to see a graph here.” - how to make graph in Python? Matplotlib? Numpy? Okay, how do either of those work? Look it up, figure out what it has, what you can use to accomplish this task.

Great! We’re off to a good start. Do that with everything else on your “to do list”. Then start writing the program. 

“I know I need X,Y, and Z libraries.” 
Import x
Import y
Import z

“Okay, I need to pull in my info.”

def info_pull():
#stuff here

“Okay, I know in need calculations.”

def calculation():
#stuff here

Etc

Pretty soon it’ll start looking more like a program, and less like an idea. 

That’s my process whenever I want to mess around and make something. It’s probably not THE ULTIMATE BIGGEST BESTEST way to do things, but for a guy just having a little fun with Python, it keeps me engaged and working on a project, rather than just thinking “that would be cool” and then doing nothing at all.",2
Python,"I have had much success in Cython with very similar stuff. *If* you can drop those loops entirely and cleanly into Cython functions, without any references to external non-primitive types, you will be able to get very substantive speed ups.

Additional tip from someone who banged head on wall for far too long on this: take *extreme* care with the details of your typing. Especially the precision. Make sure you understand exactly what flavour of int/float you are passing in and out of Python (16? 32? 64? 128?), because if you mess it up Python will deal with it fine but silently do all the casting for you, eliminating a bunch of the benefits.

Passing numpy arrays cleanly in and out of Cython is also monumentally satisfying. Can recommend.",3

Python,"I've been a SWE for 20 years and I think relying on ChatGPT is fine, and perhaps the future. I'd recommend getting the paid ChatGPT since it has an ""analyze"" feature that runs the python for you.

IMO, LLMs are the best thing for education now a days since they are like a personal tutor. Try asking it to structure your learning. It will do a great job.",1
Python,"I agree with other saying, test pypy. But ignoring that for know.

To me this, to some degree, sounds like a design trade off. You had an approach that had better performance but was less flexible and now you have worse performance but a more flexible solution.

What is more important for the business? Is the performance good enough or is it causing issues? Do you expect to need the flexibility for future extensions?
If you need both performance and flexibility, then you might need the complexity of adding another language.

Sometimes we need to write less maintainable code to hit the performance needs. And sometimes there is no good solution, they all suck and we just need to pick the one that hurts the least.",1

The results of each iteration are saved into objects that interact with one another and more complex data structures before we move to the next iteration where the pattern repeats.

Python,">Overloading the discussion of the bylaws change (47 out of 177 posts in topic at the time the moderators closed the topic), which created an atmosphere of fear, uncertainty, and doubt, **which encouraged increasingly emotional responses from other community members.**

Speak out against the authority's centralization of power and that authority will make of you an example so that everyone else knows to toe the line. Talk about creating an atmosphere of fear, uncertainty and doubt.",17
Python,"they'll ask you a relatively simple question, probably similar to an ""easy"" level problem on Leetcode. they'll want you to ask follow up questions to make sure you've understood the problem, then to design and code a solution on the whiteboard. Make sure you state your assumptions and check in with the interviewer that your assumptions are valid. 

The code should be ""Pythonic pseudocode"", meaning it should look like Python but not necessarily be code that you could execute if you ran it through the interpreter. That just means there's some wiggle room. Your intent should be clear. Once you're able to describe your intent, do so in plain English first, then start writing code. 

You should be able to talk through the solution and how it works. You should be able to address expected edge cases. You should be able to accurately characterize the time and space complexity of your solution. You should be able to reason about your solution well enough that when they ask you to improve or extend it you can at least discuss how you would go about doing so. 

My advice for you on this is to be as concise as possible and manage your time effectively. Ask clarifying questions early and often, but don't get bogged down on tangents or side-tracks. Spend no more than 5 minutes talking before you start sketching out your code. Take no more than 15 minutes to write the basic version of the code. Use the time remaining to respond to their feedback and refine/improve your code.",34

Python,"In my experience, Cython on its own ,without unboxing types, will tend to give you performance that matches the  Specializing Adaptive Interpreter(this might change in the future, if cython starts getting access to the t2 internals). I would recommend trying to rewrite some methods with cython's cdef. It is harder to write fast code in Cython  than numba, but Cython integrates better with vanilla python.

Python,... RuneScape textbook?,16

Python,"a lot of good answers but i will emphasize this:


what you have to do is profile your code to find the hotspots. Chances are there are a few locations that take up most of the execution time and this is where you will benefit from using a solution like Cython, bindings to lower level languages, etc.


Its not about rewriting the whole codebase (although that would of course make it faster as a whole)",2
Python,"It is a very valid question! Unfortunately the answer is no as the computationally intensive function works with said classes, it basically wraps around them. That requires those classes to be jitclasses themselves which without inheritancedoes not allow for the modularity we are searching for.",1
Python,That is new to me. I will definitely look it up!  Thank you!,1
Python,I see. Thank you!,1
Python,"Why not use libraries such as Jax or PyTorch? JAX has bad support for classes as it’s basically all functional programming, but classes are first class citizens in PyTorch. 

Both JAX and PyTorch allow you to compile your code making it a lot faster and both allow you to target multiple architectures (both CPU and GPU) with little to no modifications of your code. Additionally, both libraries allow your code to be scaled up to multi process environments.

The reason I am telling this is because I went through this same route myself. I tried numba, pythran, Cython and dask — all at some point or the other. And came to the conclusion that JAX or PyTorch is the better solution.",1
Python,"Sorry if my question is dumb but couldn't you simply create your classes in Python, of which the heavy computation is a numba method ?


I work on such project. We identify where the code is slow (always when a loop is present basically) and rewrite that part in numba.",1
Python,Have you considered a suitable Entity Component System?  There are some for Python and much of what you’d ordinarily do using OOP in games you do use an ECS (which has similarities but definitely isn’t the same thing).,1
Python,Also: NamedTuples might be a nice middle-ground sometimes between real classes and low-level datastructures.,14
Python,"1. You can do just one part of the app as a microservice without rewritting everything in another language.
2. There are many ways to improve performance, be sure you didn't rush to fast on Cython before using better algorithm/libraries. For example, doing a big query and then manually dispatching is often faster than doing multiple queries (Easily went from 5h script of a collegue to 15min just with that, at a single place)
3. There are things like __slot__ that helps with speed.
4. While it should support OOP, this is not ""the object' that needs to be fast, but the operations. Don't overcomplicate things for the sake of doing OOP. By the way, typing.Protocol is IMO a much better way to do polymorphism than using OOP. This would also reduce the lookup fallback.
5. You have many other python runtime (pypy, mojo, ..), but this will impact your whole app and all libraries might not be supported.",1
Python,"Cython is not really python. It is """"""c"""""" with all the footguns.",1
Python,"> Classes

cdef class declarations are still an improvement over pure python OOP, if going down the pure Cython route. Especially if using cpdef in place of def. While this needs changes to support it in your code, it isn't a _massive_ change usually and can be dealt with incrementally in the hot paths of the program.",3
Python,"It's also important to understand context. A Tuple may indeed be faster than a class, but a List is almost certainly just as slow (or slower) because the underlying implementation is likely to be even more fragmented than a class. That also ignores the likelihood of introducing bugs when you make code less developer-friendly in service of performance.

Like you said, virtual tables aren't free, and the convenience of mapping a name to a value has a cost, and every lookup incurs the same hashing cost. Having a contiguous array that you index into on the stack is a far more performant approach...but you don't usually have that level of fine-grained control in Python.

In short, trying to write performant code in Python is an exercise in futility. Python isn't ""slow"" in the sense that it *can* be fast. However, all of the reasons to pick Python inevitably incur a cost of slowness in the final result. That's why it is so popular as a ""glue"" language. Write the important stuff in a FFI call, and the business logic can be constrained to the Python code that is infinitely easier to reason.",18
Python,You can expect runtimes to be cut in half to start and   then if you introduce some typing it can go all the way to one fifth. But it depends. If you're calling cython functions a lot the increase will not be as dramatic.,3
Python,"Okay thanks, I'll check it.",2
Python,"SOLID is good for organization, but if your seeking raw performance then it works against you as you noticed. The more ""fluff"" you could say, is extra things the program has to do, instead of just have 1 giant function lol.

Ultimately it all depends on the goals of your team and willing to sacrifice paradigms for speed, but keep searching and testing things out if they give you that time.

The only other thing I can think of, if your like do a certain type of operation and your doing it in a non-optimal. Data-structures and Algorithms start coming into play here. For example if your calling the same function with the same arguments, caching result with Memoization can help. [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memoization-using-decorators-in-python/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memoization-using-decorators-in-python/)

Also profile your code that will tell you where it is spending the most time.",1
Python,"I would look into the python libraries Polars and DuckDB. You can stuff you computations inside them while being able to make it very modular. I prefer DuckDB, but Polars is also very good.

With them you can make queries that are buildable, or composable, and much much faster than doing them in pure python.

Could it be that in this case, that pattern do more harm than good? Python has to recompile every line of code each time it encounters it (becasue no jit compilation), so every call to a virtual function or getter and setter is very expensive (in this case, it is usually fine).",3
Python,I see. Maybe the approach we are going for is actually counter intuitive and not the best.,1
Python,"Apparently, the scenario is disagreeing with the PSF 🤡. This whole thing is ridiculous and I would have thought it made up or exaggerated by someone watching too much Fox News had I not read the primary sources on Discourse.",13

Python,"1. Before doing any optimization in Python, don't guess but run cprofile to identity the bottlenecks
2. Run and profile your code in PyPy first
3. If the bottleneck is in OOP-heavy code, you're more or less out of luck. Speed gains are usually only possible with functions that can be ""long running"" in C, without the need to switch back and forth between native C and running Python code (think numpy). With classes that's not really possible with extensions or Cython, other than for very simple methods and class usage. You will probably have to rewrite a lot of the classes to gain any speed from C or Cython.",7
Python,Because dependency injection of classes that share the same interface but provide different functionality allows for good modularity and easy maintainability of the code base.

In fact, his unwavering commitment to being respectful, even in the face of this farce, should be lauded.

1. One guy was being an a-hole in mailing lists.

Python,"Based on some of your other comments:

- You have a bunch of for loops
- Your code performs a bunch of mathematical operations
- You’re stuck writing in Python

I think a better approach here rather than focusing on variations of Python to perform the task is to look at the way you’re handling the data. If it’s a ton of math, can you perform them in batches instead of loops? For example, matrix operations where the math is performed across the entire set or subset rather than on individual elements will show massive improvements. Reducing the dimensionality of the data can also help here. Also, consider leveraging some faster style operations e.g., list comprehension vs for loop. And at the very end, if you have the computational power available, you can leverage parallelism to split the for loop across the set.",26
Python,"To be sure, Cython is meant to be used with Python; it generates C extensions to be called from Python. It is not a replacement for Python. So, you don't have to rewrite your whole project just to use Cython; you can focus on Cythonizing the 'hot' paths in your code base rather than rewriting the whole thing.

You can also potentially just compile your pure Python module(s) using Cython. You don't necessarily need to use the Cython language superset (e.g. a `.pyx` module) to get benefits from it. See [pure Python mode](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/pure.html) for details.


But yes, in general, programs or modules compiled with Cython are significantly faster. [As much as 100-200x faster](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/2.0/user_guide/enhancingperf.html) or more in some cases. Though, it really depends on certain characteristics of your program whether you'll see the benefits you're looking for. You may want to explore optimizing your application on a more fundamental level rather than just seeking ways of running an inefficient process faster.

This can theoretically be debated.  It's certainly possible for a particularly toxic individual's behavior to detract from a community more than their technical contributions add.

Python,"99% of the code is spent running a bunch of loops and doing heavy computations each step. It works in numba very well but it becomes problematic when we decide to modularize the individual parts to be easily interchangeable with different functions/classes. Numba does not allow for easy implementation of that (No support for inheritance so no polymorphism, functions work but keeping track of object properties becomes a problem since we can only use arrays) and we are left with multiple monolithic classes/functions that do not allow for much modularity. I was hoping the OOP support of Cython will allow for good speed gains while providing support for best coding practices. Trying to separate the computation part may be a good way to go forward if a Cython function can accept and work with python classes and their instances.",3

I'll repeat how I already addressed this:

The PSF leadership clearly does not care about project quality; half of the committee in question aren't even real developers.  But if they drive off the core value contributors, it is absolutely going to negatively affect everyone who uses the ecosystem, whether they are aware or otherwise.

It's also very much worth trying to publicize and draw attention to these issues.  This is a growing, and very concerning, trend that has also affected other projects.  The intellectual core developers of large projects are handing over control of their projects to groups of people assumed to be operating in good faith, which has resulted in the entire community being burned on several occasions.  The more awareness there is of this growing trend, the earlier it can be stopped before the rot infests more of the open source ecosystem.",6

Python,"I think the main difference is wrt automatic interpolation of locals, and other advanced functionality, like `f""{foo(x).bar[3]}""` etc.  That's something you can't (easily) do in something like Formatter, since it won't have access to those variables in the calling function (unless you do some iffy stack introspection).  Instead, it's essentially proposing building a list of objects for each fragment (including the captured values of evaluating interpolated variables/expressions), and having the formatter step involved in putting it together, with custom format code handling.

I wonder if an alternative might be to retain the formatting fragments on f-string objects.  Ie. make fstrings actually evaluate to a str subclass that has an extra `.parts` member containing the sequence of items used to build it, where the default `__str__` just concatenates them using normal format-code handling, but you can write a function that does alternate formatting if you want.  (The downside is that this likely impacts performance (though you could mitigate this by caching the string on first generation), and not being a *real* string could potentially be a backward-incompatible change - possibly another format code could be used instead)

Basically something like:

    class fstring(str):
        def __init__(self, *parts: list[Interpolation | Decoded])
            self.parts = parts
        def __str__(self) -> str: # Should maybe also cache the string.
            return ''.join(str(part) if isinstance(part, Decoded) else part.format_spec.format(s.get_value()) for part in self.parts)

DataScience,"I've seen this situation play out in two different ways.

People gatekeep their knowledge. They have spent the time to learn the undocumented tricks, the secrets of the data warehouse, the esoteric methods of solving some of the organization's problems, and generally keep their knowledge to themselves. Others in the organization start to learn that this person doesn't share, doesn't help, and views everyone as competition. While this provides some level of job protection, it also means these people have a very difficult time being promoted.

People share their knowledge freely. They help others outside their team, whether that's through sharing code, sharing notes/documentation, or even meeting 1:1 to walk someone through a challenge they are facing. While in theory, this person is giving away all of their secrets (and perceived job security), this person is actually becoming better technically. Forcing yourself to teach others complex topics makes you learn the topics better yourself. As the saying goes, *you don't really know something well until you can teach it to someone else.* Second, this person is gaining visibility throughout the organization as a team player; someone who rises above their job description, and goes out of their way to help others. The ""job security"" this person creates for themselves is not in gatekeeping their domain and being irreplaceable (and unpromotable), but in being viewed as a vital resource to the organization.

I've met people in my organization that gatekeep. Over the past four years I've been with the organization, they are still here, but also still in the same roles. Over the same time period, I've gone from an individual contributor to managing a team of data analysts. I host monthly discussions on data analytics, Power BI, and SQL, and have over 40 other data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers throughout the organization that have subscribed to my Teams channel, with about a dozen people attending each month to hear me speak about some new technical topic, as well as ask technical questions on their current projects. Other analytics teams now send their new hires to me to help onboard.

Four years ago I made it one of my career goals to become known as a technical expert and resource for data people throughout the organization. Not only did it force me to improve my technical skills, but it substantially increased my visibility to others throughout the organization. It was also a significant factor in my promotion to manager, and has given me a path towards a director role.

Your situation may be different, and you may not even want to move over to the management side. But if you do, visibility is key, and being known as the training/technical resource is one way to gain that needed visibility. Because I choose not to gatekeep, I am not defined by (or limited to) my models, my data sets, or my code. Instead, I am defined by the results I've been able to achieve and the large audience through which I share those results. Remember, my monthly meetings are presenting on new topics and techniques my team has developed. If you want to use my work of solving Problem X for my team to solve your own team's Problem X, great! Because I'm already working on Projects Y and Z right now.

Gatekeeping keeps you stagnant. If your career goals are for anything significantly higher than your current role, I would suggest focusing on the long game of building up your reputation. In the short term, it may sometimes sting when it feels like others are freeloading off your knowledge and hard work, but in the long term, I think it puts you in a much better position for a leadership role someday.",2

In those cases you can share documentation and resources with them, with the expectation that they can learn from those resources just as you did. Would this be something you're against?

Something I've been kicking around for awhile is whether some deep learning technique would benefit from spatial weights. That's a dimension of complexity you might add.

Anyway, I'd encourage you to try to pull in thousands of features about demographics, the built environment, and the natural environment (there are open sources for all of these) and go much more granular (tracts, neighborhoods, or zip codes).",0

DataScience,"I dont think you have an option to not share code with your team. Usually teams have a shared github/gitlab space, and tbh you dont even own your code, your company does. And it is your responsibility to follow good coding practices and documentation and proper testing/ peer reviews so that when you move on later on, people will be able to still use your work, which again is owned by the company. So, assuming your code is clear and well documented and tested, you can show your colleague where your code is, ask them to have a look on their own first, and then have a meeting where they can ask you specific questions they have already prepared rather than going over it together line by line.  
  
Now, training someone from scratch is not your job, (assuming you are not their manager). If you find they come to you often with very basic data science questions, and after you send them some links where to find the answer, you might want to have a talk with their line manager, as it is their job to make sure that person gets somehow the appropriate training.    
  
Having said that, you SHOULD be able to explain in simple terms all the ds methods you are using, in case you are ever asked to present in front of stakeholders or whenever you are presenting and defending your work. So, if you ever find yourself in a situation where you could not get away from explaining a basic concept to your peers, dont treat this as a waste of your time. It is actually a very good opportunity for you to practise your skills of presenting ds concepts in simple terms and also to identify knowledge gaps you might have. They say that the best test to make sure you have understood something is when you try to explain it to others. If you nail that, this is a powerful skill that can help you advance in your career.",3

You can never estimate exactly what the true elasticity moving from a price of 10 to 50 vs a price of 10 to 11. Your best bet would to incrementally run the counterfactuals and take the average of their CATEs to compute a change from 10 to 50.

DataScience,"During fit. But what about actual predictions? How do you give DML info about the incremental effect for a new price? 

At inference time for new data (new X), you don't input the treatment T in any way (as T is only used during training to weight instances and set the training target for the final stage model): it never goes inside the final stage model as a feature. Therefore, when predicting, a new value for T has no place to be entered.

That's the issue: CATE depends only on X, and not on the price level itself T. This means that an increase of T in 1 will be estimated as the same effect, no matter whether the base T (before the increase) was 10 or 10,000

Edit: new paragraph",1
DataScience,"Just read the last part of the paper, but it is still a partial linear model that assumes that price level does not impact the treatment effect; meaning that an increase of price of 1% when the base price is 100 has the same effect as an increase of price of 1% when the base price is 10,000

DataScience,"Your project sounds like it would be a good idea for a course project you're going to work on for a few months but not like a good project to be the basis for your MSc thesis.

As a course project it is perfect because you have restricted your scope and will 100% be able to accomplish your objective. Then if you get it done faster than you thought you would, you can start building in more complexity - more data, alternative modelling approaches, more rigorous evaluation, etc. Too many people aim too high for course projects, don't achieve what they set out to, and end up with only half-finished stuff to show for it at the end.

As a MSc project it is not good, for two reasons:

(1) A MSc project is supposed to at least aim to contribute to the literature in some way. I'm sure most people never publish anything from their MSc but it should be your goal. What you're proposing to do would not have been novel 20 years ago, and it's not clear that it really serves any greater purpose other than serving your own interests. For example have you done any literature review to identify (a) is this a real problem that people would want the help of an algorithm to solve, and (b) have you identified all of the most relevant factors that go into choosing what city to live in? You don't have to create a new architecture that gets a new +0.1% accuracy SOTA on ImageNet, you can leverage existing tech to solve existing problems. But they have to be real problems that actually matter and your solution has to be an attempt at an actual solution that people will use and that outperform what people are currently doing (e.g. lots of low hanging fruit in the biomedical domain for developing, or proving the feasibility of, automated tools with 2018-era ML tech).

(2) You are in graduate school and working in a research lab, not doing a side project in your spare time. Your interests should guide your project selection in that you decided to join this lab and you shouldn't be force to do something you hate, but your advisor's opinion should be taken very seriously. How many MSc students have they graduated versus how many MSc theses have you written? They know better than you do what the criteria is for a good MSc project. You will eventually have to stand up in front of a committee of faculty members and defend your MSc thesis as a novel contribution to science. Beyond that, you're occupying resources in their lab and at the university, most valuable among them is your advisor's time. So you should probably be doing something that is valuable for them, otherwise why did they hire you?",8

DataScience,"There are two modes of using models based on fitting data. The first and most common these days is for using the prediction output for a downstream task.

The second, and more statistically oriented one, is to use the model to infer conclusions about how the features impact the outcome.

In the former case, using simple models like linear regression makes sense if your problem has simple relationships and you don't want to overcomplicate the solution. Using algorithms to select features automatically defeats the point in this case. If you're anyway going to increase complexity, just use boosted tree models and call it a day.

In the latter case, you care about what the features actually are, as any conclusions you draw are *about the selected features*. Throwing proverbial spaghetti on the wall and using feature selection algorithms in this case is awfully close to Data Dredging. It's very hard to reason about the statistical implications of mining relationships out of data post hoc.

So this might be a controversial take, because I know automatic feature selection is something taught in courses on statistical learning (including the ones I took). And I'm open to being convinced otherwise - but I fail to see a use case where automated feature selection is appropriate. In my experience it's rather used to make an analysis seem more sophisticated than it needs to be or to explain why features are included in a model without having to provide a good explanation for why (e.g ""because the algorithm said so"").

I'd expect you're better off taking the time to understand the domain and really understanding the statistical interpretation of linear regression than increasing the complexity of your code / statistical model.",3

DataScience,"If you are using simple regresison models there are regularizations you can use to ""sparsify"" the model (ridge regression, LASSO) to reduce the impact of less useful features. If you are doing something more complex (SVM, random forest, etc.) you can use an iterative procedure to repeatedly perform cross-validation while dropping features from the dataset (or progressively adding features) to check how performance is impacted.

Whether correlation to the target is important depends on how complex you think the relationships / mechanisms are. That might be a good metric to use to rank features for an add/drop order but I wouldn't necessarily manually cut features just if they don't correlate well to the outcome.",1

The ideas are crystal clear, however I have no technical background. I am aware that I could go the ""easy"" ""hire a CTO and tech guys"" route. Of course I will still hire a development team, however I have time and want to deeply understand what I am doing and developing. Of Therefore I would like to ask you:

What online course can you recommend for beginner (start up founders) to get a sufficient understanding of Python/ ML/ DL/ AI/ Gen. AI?

I have looked at Courseras IBM AI Developer certificate, however have read a bad review here on reddit about it. 

What can you guys recommend?",1
DataScience,"I ask this due to how difficult it was to convincing engineering firms that I was qualified with math and physics degrees. In short, I currently hold a BS in computational physics, applied math, took a 6 month boot camp in data science, and am halfway through a MS in CS in hopes of nabbing a DS position in the future (or SWE if that falls short).

Are those degrees sufficient? Is there anything else that I should add in the mix?",1

Alternatively, you can use simple techniques to create something that is totally useful, without wasting a bunch of compute power, electricity and money. That’s so much more efficient.

This means that if you are trying to plug-in new, unobserved prices for a given set of features, whatever CATE you end up getting will only be valid (or close to reality) for an increment of 1 price unit vs the closest feature set in the training data.

DataScience,"**Exploring Alternatives to Traditional Data Science Paths**

Data science is a fascinating field, but it’s not the only route to a successful career in tech or analytics. For those considering alternatives, here are a few paths to explore:

1. **Business Intelligence (BI) Analyst**: Focuses on interpreting data to inform business decisions using tools like SQL, Tableau, or Power BI. BI roles often emphasize reporting and dashboard creation over advanced algorithms.
2. **Data Engineering**: Concentrates on building and maintaining the infrastructure that supports data collection and analysis. This role involves working with big data tools and ensuring data pipelines are robust and efficient.
3. **Product Analytics**: Involves working closely with product teams to analyze user behavior and product performance. This role often requires a strong understanding of the product lifecycle and customer journey.
4. **Quantitative Analysis**: Common in finance and investment, this path uses statistical models and financial theories to analyze market trends and make investment decisions.
5. **Marketing Analytics**: Focuses on analyzing marketing data to optimize campaigns and strategies. This role combines data analysis with a deep understanding of consumer behavior and market dynamics.

If you're looking for a structured way to gain practical skills in these areas, consider specialized bootcamps. For example, **Lejhro Bootcamp** offers targeted training in analytics and data-related fields. Unlike traditional degree programs, bootcamps provide hands-on experience and real-world projects that can quickly build your expertise and make you job-ready.

Bootcamps like Lejhro focus on practical skills and real-world applications, often offering flexible schedules and industry-relevant training that might align better with your career goals. They can be a great way to pivot into a new field or enhance your existing skill set efficiently.

So, if you're thinking about exploring beyond data science or enhancing your expertise, it’s worth checking out options like Lejhro Bootcamp. It could be the step you need to take your career to the next level.",1

But some companies (usually startups) get a mega-hardon for subjecting candidates to these ridiculously auduous and usually irrelevant tests that dont evaluate real on-the-job skills, in conditions that are completely different to how a real DS would opperate (at least you would hope so!)

DataScience,"Hey there, fellow Redditor!

As BarracudaSmart9500, I'm here to help you navigate this uncertainty.

Firstly, let me assure you that it's completely normal not to be an expert in every aspect of ML. You've got a solid 3-4 years of experience under your belt, and that's impressive! It's natural to feel like there's always more to learn, but don't worry, Tabular ML is still very much alive and kicking!

Regarding LLM (Large Language Model), it's true that you might not be familiar with the latest advancements. However, this doesn't mean you're missing out on opportunities. Think about it: many companies are still building upon traditional tabular ML techniques for their specific use cases.

What I'd recommend is this:

1. **Keep your skills sharp**: Focus on strengthening your existing Tabular ML knowledge and skills. This will help you stay competitive in the job market.
2. **Take baby steps into LLM**: Don't feel pressured to become an expert overnight! Start by exploring the basics of LLM, reading articles, or taking online courses. You can even begin with simple applications like text classification or sentiment analysis.
3. **Network and learn from others**: Attend conferences, join online forums (like this one!), or participate in discussions on platforms like Reddit's r/MachineLearning community. This will help you stay updated on the latest developments and connect with people who share your interests.
4. **Highlight transferable skills**: When applying for jobs, emphasize your existing expertise in Tabular ML and how it can be applied to various domains. Many companies still value traditional tabular ML methods.

In conclusion, don't worry about not being an expert in LLM just yet! You're already knowledgeable in Tabular ML, and that's something to build upon. Keep learning, stay curious, and remember: your experience is valuable regardless of the specific technologies you work with!

Hope this helps, my friend!

DataScience,"I'd say this type of work falls under Operations Research, in particular using linear programming.

The system was implemented in R, but Python should be just as good if not better.

The team consisted of data scientists with a mathematical background. Knowledge on both optimization and stochastics/statistics help: You optimize some compromise of different metrics with some of them being stochastic. For example, you want to minimize energy usage by having the ovens run as little as possible. This is deterministic. However, you also want to maximize the freshness of pastries when they are sold and avoid not having enough baked pastries during rush hour. Both of these are stochastic since your predictions have uncertainty.

A large part of this work also consists of talking to shareholders: What the compromise of these different metrics looks like is subjective and you need to communicate this mathematical model to non-technical people. Having good communication and data visualization skills helps.",2
DataScience,"To me the biggest limitation is the assumption that response effects are not dependent on the treatment magnitude. Since causal inference models ∂outcome | ∂treatment, there is a plethora of real-life problems where it is not really applicable (like most ones where your treatment is a continuous variable).

If my treatment is price and my outcome is sales, it is very evident that a price increase of $1 will not have the same effect if current price is $10 than if it is $100

I hope I am wrong (an please correct me if so), but I have yet to find any causal technique that can tackle that scenario for instance",1

DataScience,Can you plz dm me which company you r hiring for? Looking for job is so tough right now. Any help would be appreciated!,0
DataScience,"It's because 

1) ai isn't perfect yet especially for many complicated or complex tasks (they still have unacceptable margins of error not worth the risk or roi)

2) many companies are utilizing heavily integrated systems, networks, software, and platforms that were built to speak to each other in a privatized way that adding in ai would require re-building or establishing those processes which is unnecessary work and cost if ai is too expensive and the roi isn't there to replace the already working system for cheaper

3) ai is still insanely expensive due to data processing and ai still being pretty new (to the extent and areas it's being used and introduced to). Companies are literally laying people off and replacing them for off shore workers in India and Mexico, even Microsoft, Apple, and Google. You think all these other companies are really going to dish out yearly expenses and budget to fund 20 different ai platforms for 20 different systems when they can't even afford US workers and have to nickle and dime everything and offshore work still? 2-3 indian workers or even intl in EU (since they make less in general) is salaried at what 1 US employe is being paid, sometimes the ratio is even worse",1

DataScience,"Appreciate the lengthy reply. I agree your point on the separation of batch vs real time inferencing.

I have built REST APIs (Sentiment analysis) specifically for front end applications for another in house product using flask and fast api or even Django. Likewise, hosting a computing node for batch inferencing with data loaders using PyTorch. 

Probably not the best design, but those APIs either have a copy of the model weights in their own environment or it’s a Docker Image that was built along with the weights. The MLOPs/ CICD aspect of things isn’t the best in my opinion. 

So now I’m moving to vertex ai pipelines and probably gonna test out the vertex ai endpoints as suggested by many. The model garden along with tensor board within GCP also sounds very fun but they seem to be costly. 

Perhaps the reason I avoided these solutions initially is primary due to the influence of my previous System Analyst. She once told me to try making modules and applications platform agnostic so we can migrate anytime. 

Not to mention, I can always start small and test with smaller nodes at startups - but now at a bigger corp, there are blockage even accessing internal endpoints and many other things. 

Anyhow, vertex ai endpoints along with model garden is on my list atm.",1

DataScience,"Hi Super thanks for the answer! I probably should rephrase my question. Would you buy it? If not, is it because you don't really have needs for custom data in your day to day job or you think data quality/quantity is not ready yet? 

I completely agree with you, from a business stand point, what we are doing is unfavorable. I think we have a problem we want to solve, but ignored how many people have the same problems.    
  
In terms of roadmap, we are a bit struggling to decide whether we should continue to further expand the overall semantic understanding/searching/extraction capability(original roadmap) or identifying a niche field and go all-in. The risk of first one is continue to do something no one REALLY need. The risk of second one is all the time searching niche is cost opportunities to continue improve the product performance.

DataScience,"On reputation I would be sketched out unless your specific goal is to work in a more legacy environment like government, health care, insurance, etc. SAS was developed at NC State in the 60s/70s, so that program predictably focuses on SAS.

DataScience,"I can't tell you if your product is payable or not, your niche will. Have you identified it?

What worries me is that you are already building without having the knowledge if there are a good number of people willing to pay, that's risky.

Why don't you send an email to friends and contacts introducing the product and asking for money? If they say ""yes, sir, take my money and solve my problem"" you are probably on the right path. Also, early users are your best friends, ask them how much would they pay for the tool, ask them what features would make them pay even more.

Honestly, I think your idea has potential since it's trying to solve a common problem for data roles, most of SMEs have at least one, the market is huge. Achieving PMF, that's easily a million dollar idea.

DataScience,"I dunno man…

If what you mean is “there’s no single LLM which can handle such a complex, multi-step task with many constraints with perfect accuracy”, that’s probably true. But most industry use cases - the wise ones anyway - break down these tasks into simpler ones that then get distributed across multiple LLMs which are all pipelined together to form a single system. Some of these systems can even involve LLMs capable of doing non-LLM things like executing CRUD operations, or reading from external knowledge stores like spreadsheets and updating their own memory in-context.

This notion is recently being abstracted into the concept of LLM agents, which represent the bleeding edge right now. It’s not hard to imagine such a system being able to handle the task you describe, maybe not with perfect accuracy, but probably well enough that it justifies the cost.

Point here being that a future where AI systems which can distill complex, unpredictable problems into functioning SQL statements is by no means far off.",1
DataScience,"There's a lot of particulars needed to understand the proper design pattern. I think you basically have a common design pattern (except for the pubsub, are you talking about a queue or the interface?).  The big three clouds should make it plenty easy to setup an inference endpoint--like VERY easy.  You dont need docker, you can use their 'bring your own model' (google it) design pattern and insert your model in their off-the-shelf containers (Sagemaker has Pytorch wrapped and ready, and I would be surprised if GCP didn't have the equivalent),

(maybe this?  
[https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/prebuilt-containers-with-pytorch-and-vertex-ai](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/prebuilt-containers-with-pytorch-and-vertex-ai)  
)

  
 and it can autoscale as needed.  Or if you want to run it batch, you don't need the endpoint  you would batch over it with a processing node(s). It depends on MANY other requirements, (speed, cost, etc), but you need your users to get their inferences and that would come with some interface to your inference engine hosted on some machine and you need to design the interface--whether that's REST calls, a webpage etc it's generally some sort of API (even browser-based can run off of REST).  If you want a loosely-coupled architecture--and you should--I can't think of a better interface than an API (for real-time inference, of course there are other patterns for batch--like process and push to a frontend)

I'm actually trying to think of an alternative or how you would do this the wrong way, but interested to hear other responses.",1

DataScience,"Try to narrow it down a bit.  'Data Scientist' for the longest time meant different things to different people. Now it's kind of a catch-all for evolving roles that some people still want to add things to data science. And often 'Data Scientist' means 'the technical person on the team that can get stuff done that others cant'  Do you want to work for the Magnificent Seven, startup, non-profit, consulting, finance.  They all will have different common skillets.   And Data Science is blending (or branching off?) into MLOps/Engineering and AIEngineering and others.  In fact it seems like these latter roles are becoming more in demand. I also disagree with those claiming you need all sorts of math.  Don't get me wrong, I love math (BS in Applied), it's always helpful, and it will turn you into a great data scientist and you do need a minimum. But the clients and companies cared more about how to create data science pipelines, how to clean and shape data, how to put something into production than how to run a ANOVA test or run a cox regression analysis.  Knowing lots of math can help. It does come up, and you should learn it, but there are other hard skills you should learn first.    
  
\* SQL does seem to come up a little bit everywhere.    
\* Python -  definitely.  But know how to write GOOD python. My god data scientists can't write production-level code to save their life. They are UNIVERSIALLY bad at it. Everyone in this thread is HORRIBLE AT IT! (Ok that's a joke ;) )  You should learn how to write GOOD python more than OOP. Youll be scripting most of the time, and only the bad data scientists think they should wrap their dataframe in a custom object.    
\* Knowing how to write, how to explain--how to use words efficiently--is a good softer skill that will take you far.   
\* Most of all: Knowing how to solve any hard problem well -  do understand how to solve hard problems using the best heuristics if you dont have the experience?  I've met so many juniors that are overly ambitious, don't take their time, and don't realize their model is leaking information or their data doesn't have the informational capacity to solve the problem at hand no matter how many XGBoosts, LLMs or Quantum Computing they throw at it ;)",1

In the last 15 its been artificial neural networks, and in the past 6 its been transformer based artificial neural networks. But that's becoming increasingly niche.

DataScience,"So... as someone who holds too many degrees, I can say a few things. And yes, most DS degrees out there suck. So the recommendation is to do MS in Statistics or CS instead, and choose as many electives in the counter part as possible. For example, if you are doing Stats, choose as many CS electives as possible.

However, if you insist on doing a Masters in Data Science, here are things to look out for.

- *duration*: 1 year masters degrees are likely bad, no matter what the prerequisites. one cannot cover all the basics in just one year.
- *prerequisites*: there are masters degrees that are meant for ""deeper study"" and there are those for ""career change"". If the degree doesn't ask for an undergraduate degree in a cognate discipline, then it is likely a bad degree. You should be expected to have completed introductory linear algebra, calculus, probability, statistics, programming, and database courses *before* the masters degree. Otherwise, you end up with a cohort that has trouble installing python, struggle with finding the minima of a curve. And 2 years is barely enough time to even catch them up to even a bachelor level.
- *difficulty*: data science at the masters level should be difficult. For statistics and machine learning courses, you can usually tell by the textbooks being used. Hastie, Bishop, and Murphy textbooks for machine learning are at the masters level.
- For computing it is a bit more varied. Look at the descriptions. If ""intro"" is all you are getting (loops & condition, OOP) then it is not a real degree. Instead, CS courses should offer real problem solving: optimisation, entity resolution, reinforcement learning, deep learning, architecture, information security, cloud computing etc.
- *reputation*: this one is... admittedly my bias. But if the university is not in the top 100 (maybe 200) in the world (either THE or QS rankings) then I would have my doubts. The difference is quite stark. But, the prerequisites thing should be a good filter against this anyway.",39

DataScience,"I'm a hiring manager for an MLE team at a faang and this might be controversial but we prefer STEM fields, specifically PhDs that have used ML or stats and coding in their research, or have since worked with it in industry. Our work is very applied and involves a lot of software engineering along with the ML and we find having the unique perspectives from various science fields has brought tons of innovation. It's also high customer facing decisioning so requires minds that constantly anticipate what could go wrong and prepare for it. Our experience with data science degree folks has been a lot of buzz words and slow to get out of the analysis/modeling trap and consider stakeholders and customer experience. Science PhDs can better juggle the complexities of our systems, find ways to get value, and pick out edge cases well.

DataScience,"Career Pivot from Sales w/liberal arts undergrad 

Hi, I have a question for those of you who understand what it's like to be a data engineer and be prepared for a career in the field. I wanted to know what advice you can share with me as well as how I can overcome some potential obstacles (I will outline below). 

Here's some background about me:

- I have an undergraduate degree in the Humanities (it's in an ethnic studies field). I know that it was not the smartest degree choice and that there is no money in the field I majored in, but by the time I hit senior year I was already working in sales full time and just wanted to finish college. 
- I am enrolling this fall in a Masters Science in Data Analytics program. It is for working professionals so I can still work full time.
-I don't want to enter the (non-existent) job market relevant to my undergraduate major. I honestly regret what I got my undergrad degree in as it has had a 0% ROI in the 1+ years since I graduated. 
- I currently work in SaaS sales and have 2 years of experience in the industry; my total work experience is about 6 years of retail/service to pay my way through college. I don't want to stay in sales forever (I hate it). Hence, I'm using a burner account to post this question lol. 

I want to become a data engineer or database manager because as I've worked in SaaS I've realized how powerful and fun data analytics is. I want to make a career out of it and my workplace seems supportive. 

While I know that an M.S. helps with the fundamentals, what outside of a degree would help me prepare for a career in data engineering? I know I will need to understand R, Python, and SQL programming, but what else? I do not have a technical undergrad degree but I do have passion for the field. Should I pursue certificates? Is it too late for an internship? Any advice helps greatly, thank you so much. 

P.S. if you've read this far down: I understand that this is Reddit but I do ask that you have empathy for me as I am only 22 and graduated college a year ago at 21. I started college at 17 and just felt that as a high school graduate getting a degree was the natural progression for me. I bounced around majors and the one I ended up with is what I have a degree in. I learn quickly and avoided STEM because I thought I was bad at math (but realized I just had bad math teachers in HS, haha).",2

- The Flask route used to connect when receiving the right GET request on my site
- The actual query to aggregate volume weighted financial data over intervals of a user defined length

It's really easy to load datasets in or load an assessment in an environment that will run the code. If people are not doing this then they're lazy or it's not necessary. In my cases I often just want someone to write some code and walk me through their thought process I don't need them to live code a model or something.

The coordinate transformation between the robot's pose and the camera's pose was also an orthogonal matrix that we needed to multiply by/invert a lot in the code.

SELECT person_id
FROM people_records
WHERE YEAR(
    (SELECT MIN(record_date)
     FROM people_records pr2
     WHERE pr2.person_id = people_records.person_id)
) = 'your_year_here';
```

### Explanation:
- `people_records`: This is your table containing the records.
- `person_id`: This is the identifier for people in your table.
- `record_date`: This is the date field of the records.
- The inner subquery `SELECT MIN(record_date)` finds the earliest record date for each `person_id`.
- The outer query checks if the year of this earliest record is equal to the year you are interested in (`your_year_here`).

You would replace `'your_year_here'` with the specific year you're looking for.",2

Also if multiplying two matrices makes you believe that you are doing 'linear algebra' then I think you have misunderstood something very fundamental about mathematics.

I even studied applied riemannian geometry and lie theory, Ive never used it. It is true many libraries have their origins in numerical linear algebra, but why on earth would you reinvent the wheel.

DataScience,"Hi, I liked your answer. I'm kind of on the same boat as the OP. I have a degree in Business and my experience has been mostly in Sales. 

I have a question for you, I'm about to start a 7-month diploma at my university next month and I'm torn between 2 different diplomas. Note to mention after this diploma I will be enrolling in a 1-year master degree in either Big Data (from an engineering school), or Business Analytics (from a business school).

My main question is how important is it to learn deeper statistics and time series for a data analyst or a business analyst in banking. Or should I focus more on learning the general topics and tools for a data analyst even if that means sacrificing learning deeper statistics. I would like to target banks or credit institutions, finance in general,  during my internship search and after my masters program.

  
The first diploma option emphasizes more data science for finance, with 5 modules focused on:

1. Learning and applying Python on finances.     

2. Fundamentals of statistics and probability and a bit of linear algebra with Python.      

3. Databases with SQL, data manipulation, Webscrapping, analysis of natural language, Algorithmic trading.     

4. A module on Machine Learning, supervised and unsupervised models, regression models, a little bit of time series, portfolio optimization. 

5. A module on deep learning.

  
The second 7-month diploma is almost completely focused on Statistics and time series, these are the 5  modules:

1 - Statistics fundamentals. 2- Linear regression models. 3- Time series models for forecasts 4- Time Series Analysis 5- Multiple time series studies 

I would appreciate your advise!",1

I gotta be honest with you I'm not really familiar with any of those certs, and the thing about MOOCs is they're not always accredited so jobs don't always take them seriously (for right or wrong). I would lean towards the Microsoft (or Amazon for AWS) ones because you at least have the brand recognition of the company behind it. 

if you want to get into a degree program, you can typically find the requirements on their website and if not, you can email them with your background and ask if you'd be competitive as an applicant. Though I would recommend considering stats, computer science, or even math over data analytics as a major.",1

DataScience,"My first job was OR/DS in a supply chain arm of a big company. I was responsible for the projects end-to-end, day-to-day job was pretty much similar to a ""regular"" DS job: data collecting, data cleaning and etc. The data was all time-series and I was required to do things like optimization too.

One of my projects was risk modeling, another one was optimizing the flow in a CD. It was fun and the company had a pretty nice working environment, so it was easy talking to people and when more data were needed people would be really interested in helping and trying to find the most available data possible.

I think the main difference from a DS job was that frequently I had to use other techniques, like any OR job. Supply Chain problems are hard to solve and sometimes you'll get into a NP-hard problem, e.g., 3D bin packing problem.",1

In-depth understanding not only of the math and algorithms but also of the domain you'll be working in, and understanding the specifics of the problems you'll be working on, is fundamental. I've seen many people just apply some method they like onto a problem they're presented with, even when the method is absolutely useless for that specific problem. Or they don't understand which performance metric to optimize for in a given case, etc. Understanding what you're doing is crucial. And it's not about the equations themselves, it's about the concepts. But often when you understand the concept, you'll figure out the math as well.

DataScience,"I'm a PhD student in immunology, currently writing my thesis and on the market, trying to transition. I've applied to a few jobs with ~no response, but now I have two options lined up.

One is an offer I received for a Data Scientist role at the UK Office of National Statistics (ONS). However, it's a 6-month contract, and the recruiters are pressuring me to accept quickly which is ick (it's also my first time dealing w/ recruiters; I really don't like not being able to talk to the employer). They are dangling ""there's a good chance it could become permanent"", but I'm not stupid and know exactly what that means. They say the ONS might not wait for my next interview, which is on Tuesday.

The Tuesday interview is with a private sector company that makes low-code data science software. The role is more focused on software development (in a DS heavy context) and likely better paid with a longer contract, but it’s just an initial HR screen. I was referred to the role by a friend, so I’ve got a foot in the door, but frankly my CV isn’t ideal for it, and I’m unsure if I’ll progress further in the process.

Should I take the ONS job, despite the short contract, or wait and see how the dev opportunity pans out? Or, do I take the ONS job and continue with the dev interviews? My current thought is to accept the ONS offer and then just burn them if I get an offer for the dev job. But burning the ONS is also a bit scary, they're not exactly small fries.",1
DataScience,"Unfortunately due to complications moving countries and all, I am unable to continue working in the medical field and want to pursue a different path.

I prefer not to go for a university degree again, but it is still an option if all else fails. The online courses seem promising, but I also read that entry level jobs these days still require more than the online courses such as that of Masterschool's. 

The reason I posted this was not to bore you with the repeated question of whether I should trust online schools (you are ofcourse welcome to still comment on that, I value your opinions highly), but I'd simply want to know, do you reckon I have a chance at becoming a Data Scientist without a bachelor's degree? I am 30 years old and would like to not spend another 4 years in the university. Obviously I am not aiming for a very well paying job as I clearly would need at least a Master's degree.

DataScience,What’d do you use for time series analysis? R is a personal fav,-6
DataScience,If it can’t load smoothly into Excel (~1GB). Lol,14
DataScience,"Math and Stats. Any program that teaches you how to only type python packages is useless. In my 20 years of fitting regression  for either school or work, I've had to do them in 8 different languages or software packages (TSP, STATA, Shazam, R, RATS, SAS, Python, Excel). SQL is something that you can pick up in an afternoon.

Underlying math and advance statistics knowledge is what I'd call a **hard skill**. They've been used in these fields for decades. Professors in the 1980s were doing these fitting regression models on punch card computers.  In the 1950s they often computed it by hand.

Essentials:

1. Multivariate Calculus (Calculus III at 98 percent of American schools) and Linear Algebra. You need these two tools for advanced study of statistics and optimization
2. Probability using Calculus or Mathematical Statistics. Probability is sometimes a pre-req for math stats, math stats basically focuses on the mathematical properties of statistical distributions. You kind of learn the same thing in a probability course, but probability courses also focus on things like combinatorics.

Useful Classes:

1. Numerical Analysis/Methods/Programming using mathematical software - this is useful for learning how to impliment optimization functions in a comptuer context. Math and probability theory frequently use continuous functions, but reality is data is discrete. So these
2. Non-Linear Programming/Optimization. The term programming in math classes usually refers to solving optimization problems.

**Why am I so focused on optimization? Because nearly all modeling frameworks in statistics, algorithm, econometrics and computational mathematics is comes optimization methods.** They are fundamental methods for any advanced study beyond undergraduate level at a rigorous program. Furthermore, advanced study of mathematical oriented subjects generally involves getting mathematical maturity to pick up stuff.

I think terms of stats and mathematical modeling courses its really hard to go by course names, because different fields often teach the same subject under a different name. You want a course on Linear Models (Different types of linear regression models, logistic regression, probit) and you can really spend years just studying about these methods, economist do this. Time Series, Panel Regressions. You want a standard supervised learning course that covers things like decision trees, forests, XG Boost  and how to think about ML v.s. just being a forecaster (its a subtle difference). You probably want a course on unsupervised learning that heavily deep learning methods (neural networks) and then electives that apply these methods. Stats methods are so widely used that people really do learn it at different level of depth.

Other tools you want. Courses that really teach you about  **o**bject oriented programming and good programming practices.",3

DataScience,"My threshold tends to be the volume at which horizontal scaling (adding nodes) is considered instead of vertical scaling (using a bigger VM).

Obviously that depends on your workload, too, but for a generic and balanced workload (not particularly constrained by either memory or CPU),  I’d say working on the order of 500 GB or more is worthy of being called “big data.” While you can certainly find high-mem VMs with many TBs of RAM, the cost-per-GB increases exponentially and availability becomes a lot harder to secure.",15

DataScience,"You're getting a lot of different answers because ""data science"" is a very broad field. 

In general, you'll often need to know how to communicate information in an effective way, regardless of the role; you can learn this in HCI classes focused on visual communication or information design. 

You'll need an understanding of statistics at the very baseline, and likely more for more challenging work. 

You'll need basic levels of college math (calc, linear algebra). 

You'll need to know how to get the data you want using SQL queries, and conduct analyses on it using R or python. 

You may need familiarity with dashboarding tools such as tableau/looker/etc.

You'll also need to write very clearly and understand the concepts you're dealing with well enough to inform a lay audience of decision-makers. 

Some jobs will emphasize multiple of these elements; others just one. 

p.s. Knowing how to work with time series is never going to be a drawback; you may not have to address those types of problems at your job, but understanding the mathematics behind time series analysis is going to be beneficial. Learning how to answer as many different types of problems is a great way to think about your education.",12

I mean, most of my development happens in Jupyter Lab or Zepellin and it's mostly scripting with pandas, keras, statsmodels, etc. and usually putting the results either in Tableau or in a PPT to present to management. Sometimes I have the need to create a pipeline to process the data, insert it in the model and publish results in a dashboard or report. I hardly have the need to create Classes or throw exceptions (last one I had to create was to implement lazy loading of a huge dataset).

Most ds programs don’t equip you with the statistical nor cs fundamentals to really hit the ground. 

Even traditional stats programs struggle to churn out students that can hit the ground running because frankly: most places can’t afford things like rcts and don’t have curated knowledge to use traditional methods. Moreover, unless you want to grab some theory that allows you to leverage things like nns-a ton of programs just won’t give you say, a Bayesian option to learn the math +make connections to statistical learning theory as a whole 

If you want to build robust models: then you need a robust backbone in probability theory. This is at least a few quarters/sems of real analysis before you get to your first grad level course where ironically you will probably be unlearned a lot of stuff in a typical undergrad stats course.

Hypothetically speaking, if you could start today, learn all the modules of your choice in a single day and graduate tomorrow, I'd recommend to focus in Large Language Models which is the hot topic of the moment. But what is going to be hot next year is anyone's guess...

As I just mentioned in the post just below yours, I have 13 years of data science experience (since 2009) and didn't get to the next round of a position because the interviewer asked a question about developing a class for multithreading in I/O operations in python. What does it has to do with data sciences? Very little, but landing a full time job will require you to go through that kind of stuff. R is a very good language to know in data sciences and it will depend on the company but usually you will have to go through code interview in which your R skills will be tested so you will need to practice it often.

Doing master with a full time job may be tough unless you have only the dissertation left.

Since you have no professional experience, I don't think you will be asked system design questions.

In my PERSONAL opinion, below are good things to focus as entry level:

* practice R (I think [hackerrank.com](http://hackerrank.com) supports R)
* everything data (manipulation, querying, transforming, summarizing, etc.)
* applying basic models to problems (two good to know are regressions and decision trees)

Last Friday, I interviewed for a company in a similar business and the first round was a code interview. But they asked me to code I/O operations using multithread in python? 

Is this something that data scientist needs to know today? Is the code interview for a data scientist the same as for a software engineer?

I think the problem is that most bootcamp teach in 3-6 months or so. There is just not enough time to teach properly. I teach a relatively advanced course for 🥜. It's fast paced and takes 1.5 years of commitment. Personal project you have to do it on the side. I spoon feed advanced stuff with notebooks to get a good feel of concepts. Now no one wants to really learn the stuff. I find it challenging to find motivated people who really want to learn. Haha. That's the reality.

DataScience,"There's a lot wrong in what you said. You don't fit test data, you predict on it. Are you talking about scaling numerical features before fitting the model like minmax scaling? If that's needed for your model then you need to do it before fitting the training data and again when you predict the test set. This isn't related to leakage it's more about model convergence and over fitting due to some numerical features overpowering others if they're not all scaled to a similar range.

It doesn't seem like your boot camp is doing a good job giving an overview of the core machine learning techniques. I highly recommend you find the old Andrew Ng lectures from coursera. Just a few hours of videos and you'll understand all these basics and more.",1
DataScience,"To me it looks like your model learned a simple decision boundary. Because your auc curve and density plot look very simple. Could be underfitting, if you are sure that your data is not that simple. You could fit a logistic regression and see if you get similar results. Also, 100 features are a lot, maybe you should increase the complexity in hyperparameters. You could also experiment with other types of models like MLP or logistic regression, because some datasets are better suited to them. Permutation importance could also give info about how much each feature affect your decision.

Feature elimination could also improve your results. Because when there are a lot of features, few important features may not get fully utilized.",7

Eh, I mean, I'm a chemist by training, so I'm mostly focused on the chemistry field. Maybe looking for companies/departments that have a strong focus on STEM R&D or need STEM expertise might be a way, e.g. a job in manufacturing/quality control?

Obviously, that's no guarantee that departments aren't 20 years behind in all things data but in my limited experience the natural sciences mindset (technicians, or more academically minded people) made it easier for me to communicate with them.",2
DataScience,"The ""data science field"" is too vast and as a result your question is too vague for anyone to be able to give you a useful answer.

I'd recommend researching what positions there are, what skills they require. Then decide which ones make sense with your skills and expertise, and which ones you might want to develop into (the two are separate).

There's tons of material (videos, articles) on exactly these questions on the internet, plus an unending number of courses. Doing your research on these will help you ask more defined questions and people will be able to help you in a better way.

I'd also challenge your statement by saying: no, you will not be job-ready and the jobs/companies will also not be waiting for you. 

I'm saying this with all the possible love (and I'm _not_ saying that to make you feel bad ♥️). In my opinion, you might first want to figure out what kinds of job you want to do. Then you might consider internships as a way to gain some working experience in that field or an adjacent field. After that you will still be a (potential) junior and you will have to make a transition from uni to the business life - if you haven't worked in a company before it usually takes about a year to fully acclimatise to the way things are done in a company setting.

So, by 2026 you'll really be a beginner and you'll be able to start out your career. And that's perfectly normal and okay. 🙂",3

DataScience,"Basically, you're looking at a data analyst career path.

I'd try and get as much experience on the job as possible. Come up with data projects in your current position that ideally fulfil two criteria:

- it's beneficial for your team/department
- it helps you to learn a new or solidify an existing data skill. 

Personally, I started out by suggesting and implementing a database solution at my former work place.

I'd also add low-code platforms to the software mix, I'm personally partial to KNIME but there are others, too. If also look into some basic python - there's a book called ""Automate the boring stuff with python"" which might be interesting to you.

For databases and Excel/PowerBI it's maybe worth to have a basic understanding of what the data modeling looks like. 

Every field, every department has different requirements for their data analysts, so there's no two similar positions. I would therefore suggest to mentally separate your endeavour into two: 

- transitioning along the Data Analyst dimension (through learning, personal development and through leveraging your current position as much as possible) and
- transitioning out of HR recruiting (transitioning ""away from"" might not be enough, ""where to?"" may be a more helpful mindset).

You may be able to leverage your data analytics learnings to transition out of HR work but your subject matter expertise is also very valuable, especially coupled with an above average data understanding. So, chances are that you'll find a lot of jobs that require an HR background and analytics expertise. But by that time you've achieved all of that your current job may have changed already because people know you as the ""data"" guy - or in other words: you may consider pushing for these changes in your current position already and create a niche for yourself. 🤗",3

DataScience,"My suggestion is to do what interests you and not worry about designing for other people yet. Follow your curiosity, share your results, and if it's useful to others, good things will follow. Worst case, you learned some things about how the Internet works and practiced DS skills.",1
DataScience,"Yes.

By and large you can say that it's basically the main job of a data scientist in business to communicate with business. Business people are the experts in doing business, they've been doing it successfully for years. Conversely, by their studies alone, data scientists have no understanding of the business. So, basically you need to convince people in business that you:

- understand them, understand their needs and understand their work,
- know what you're talking about when suggesting a presumably better solution to their existing processes (do they even need one?) and
- can _implement_ the solution with minimal disruption to their daily work? If you can get a 5% increase in efficiency but business has to halt for two weeks, it might not be worth it - or you might have to convince people in different levels of hierarchy - for which you need political capital (for which you need stakeholder management).


The times when IT professionals were isolated ""loners"" are in the past (if that ever even was the case). Now, there's some positions that are more client-facing and some that are less so but all will have to deal with stakeholders at some level. Chances are you can find your happy spot somewhere along that spectrum.

However, it's possible that it's the specific people you are working with that are draining your energy, not the communication itself. Maybe in another place where your boss keeps stupid demands off your back and where people are more appreciative of other colleagues' time and work, you'd fare better. Or it might be a problem of not setting your boundaries and enforcing them. Or it is a systemic problem and the company doesn't have any rules about protecting their employees - like actively encouraging managers not to have their team members do overtime.

I'd suggest you try and figure out what exactly makes you miserable in your current position - the team, the boss, bad company culture, missing support, the work itself? Plus, I'd try to figure out what _you_ would need in an ideal job to flourish and enjoy working. For me that would be independent work with flexibility, a boss that trusts me and interferes minimally and challenging projects that satiate my curiosity. I also need client interaction but I fare best with people of an academic background.  Other people have their own needs that will very much differ from mine.",2

DataScience,"For the people asking, here's a bit of context:

I have been given some monthly datasets from a planning model that stretches over 70 years. This is environmental data (agricultural water usage). These monthly values are based on a review of a few historic years of daily data and then a variety of filling techniques to create monthly data for the entire 70-year period.

The goal is to run these datasets on a daily basis, but, as I mention above, the daily datasets that the monthlies are based on are sparse so I can't just use the daily data again.

The model we are using is very old and has an internal temporal disaggregation function but it creates the ""Bad"" dataset from the example in the picture I posted. The internal method determines the ""slope"" of the daily values based on the months before and after, and then creates a linear daily dataset at that slope. This method preserves monthly totals, but it also creates the ""stair stepping"" that happens at the end of each month (edge of each bar).

The smoothing techniques recommended here are useful, but most of them fall down either because they don't preserve monthly totals OR the end of each month has a large jump in values. These answers get at what I am trying to do:

You do basically need to smooth a curve but NOT the one suggested by the original sales graph. That's an accounting of every unit sold that month, if you smooth it and apply the numbers to days, you will multiply the totals by 30.

Instead, you should: 

- Divide each total by the number of days in that month (this will make up for the fact that you are translating the area in a bar that covers a month to the area of a bar that covers a day)
- Use a curve smoothing or interpolation technique to estimate the curve between daily samples
- Calculate the daily value - height of the curve at the time

This is such simple calculus that most people aren't thinking about it. You can get close by just interpolating or smoothing the monthly totals and dividing by 30.",2

If we're already in business, the best tech stack is the one that we already use; and if we're starting out, the best tech stack is the one that will get us to market fast enough, with a product good enough to get revenue started, and using a widely available pool of skilled resources.

If we're having a tech problem - such as responsiveness or ""performance"", we diagnose it and find ways to improve things, and the tools available will be dependent on the tech stack we've chosen.

DataScience,"> what about the HDSBCAN algorithm could have made it perform better in your case when the ""absolute"" information was dropped in favor of the ""relative"" pairwise distances?

My guess would be that this comes down to technical implementation details. Many implementations of HDBSCAN use tree-based spatial indexing to significantly drop the computation complexity (from O( n^2 ) or O( n log n )), and in those cases you want the absolute positions. Unfortunately these spatial indexing trees require the triangle inequality to hold for the distance metric being used, and it does not hold for cosine distance in general, and thus isn't supported. You can, however, get around this by using a different code path (with O( n^2 ) complexity) that simply uses a precomputed distance matrix.

A better trick is the L2 normalize all your embedding vectors and use euclidean distance which will effectively be the same as cosine distance (and generally a good approximation at the smaller distance scales that HDBSCAN will tend to care about). Of course the remaining catch is that spatial indexing trees don't work well on high dimensional data and in the case your effective complexity is going to be back near O( n^2 ) anyway.",2

DataScience,"In practice GMMs can be a somewhat poor fit for clustering transformer embeddings, but, as with all things unsupervised, there are no single right answers and a lot will depend on what you are hoping to achieve as the downstream task (quasi-labelling, exploration, summarization, etc.)

Why might GMMs not be the best choice? In high dimensions (the native dimension of the transformer embeddings) GMMs tend not to work well because fitting a full covariance with that many dimensions is not computationally tractable. Yes, you can constrain things to diagonal covariance, or even just spherical gaussians, but those are pretty hard constraints enforcing pretty strong assumptions (blessed axis directions, spherical clusters etc.) that can result in suboptimal clustering. Combine that with other associated curse of dimensionality problems and the results can tend to be underwhelming.

The natural path is then to try some dimension reduction techniques to get down to something tractable for a GMM. PCA will, as you've likely experienced, tend to crush clusters together in an undesirable way. That pushes you toward manifold learning techniques like ISOMAP, t-SNE, UMAP etc. These can work pretty well, especially if you allow them to use more than 2 dimensions (as you would for visualization purposes). The catch is that almost all of these algorithms tend to produce low dimensional representations that have a lot of oddly shaped and slightly stringy clusters. At this point GMMs are again a poorer fit, as they have that hard gaussian assumption. Even with full covariance estimation GMMs are going to struggle to do a good job carving up the very non gaussian clusters that these manifold learning algorithms tend to produce.

What you will tend to get more of, especially from the likes of t-SNE and UMAP, is oddly shaped but dense regions of data that are somewhat cleanly separated from each other by significantly more sparsely populated regions. This sort of oddly shaped cluster that can be well picked out by variation of density is really the prototypical example of the kind of thing that density based clustering algorithms are for. I like [this article](https://pberba.github.io/stats/2020/01/17/hdbscan/) if you are looking for a good introduction to the philosophy of density based clustering.

Personally, I would go with UMAP + HDBSCAN because I have had a lot of good results with it in the past, and I have worked with them a lot. You can definitely swap in alternatives, but you'll want a more manifold-learning-oriented dimension reduction, and then likely a density based clustering approach as a result. If you really don't like that a graph clustering approach on the knn-graph of the data can work, but it also has a lot of assumptions (a key one being that most modularity-based graph clustering methods assume a different graph model than you are likely to see from a knn-graph).

tl;dr: high dimensional clustering is hard; dimension reduction methods suitable for clustering tend to produce results that are more amenable to the assumptions of density based methods.",3

DataScience,"Method 1:  
You want to retain monthly totals, therefore you can first integrate your original time series over time.

f(t) = original daily time series  
F(T) = Integral f(t) dt  -- accumulative time series

Now you interpolate F(T) with cubic splines on times ti = t1, t2, ... tn , where ti are the first of each month,  
S(ti) = F(ti)

then your smoothed daily interpolation is  
s(t) = d/dt S(t)  
which is a quadratic functions.

Method 2:  
Use any smoothing method to derive the interpolation s(t) from the original curve f(t).  
For out monthly totals of both S(ti) and F(ti).  
Error correct s(t) by the fudge factor F(ti)/S(ti) for each month to scale the monthly totals up or down.

MachineLearning,"Nah, they'll do 9 degrees of family extermination for this /s.

Yeah, plagiarism is for the actual work, not random snippets that are coincidentally the same.",1
MachineLearning,"Well, let's start by differentiating between the three types:

BatchNorm: For a (B, T, C) tensor, BatchNorm computes the mean and variance across the batch (B) and sequence length (T) dimensions for each channel/embedding (C). This results in C different means and variances, one for each channel/embedding. The normalization is applied to each channel/embedding independently across all samples and sequence positions.

LayerNorm: For a (B, T, C) tensor, LayerNorm computes the mean and variance across both the sequence length (T) and channel/embedding (C) dimensions for each sample in batch (B). This results in B different means and variances, one for each sample in the batch. The normalization is applied independently to each sample across all its sequence positions and channels/embeddings.

RMSNorm: For a (B, T, C) tensor, RMSNorm operates similarly to LayerNorm but only computes the root mean square (RMS) across both the sequence length (T) and channel/embedding (C) dimensions for each sample in the batch (B). This results in B different RMS values, one for each sample. The normalization is applied by dividing each sample's activations by its RMS value, without subtracting the mean, making it computationally more efficient than LayerNorm.

Since BatchNorm computes the mean and variance across the batch dimension and depends on batch size, it is not used in transformers due to variable sequence lengths in NLP. It also requires storing running mean and variance for each feature, which is memory-intensive for large models. LayerNorm is preferred not just in NLP but even in vision based transformers because it normalizes each sample independently, making it invariant to sequence length and batch size. RMSNorm operates in a very similar manner to LayerNorm but is more computationally efficient (since, unlike LayerNorm, mean subtraction is not performed and only RMS values are calculated) and can potentially lead to quicker convergence during training.",3

MachineLearning,You don't really need a musical background for this. It's all just autoregressive generation.,-1
MachineLearning,"I don't have a strong musical background so please correct me if I get parts of this wrong.   
  
I think the first step would be to decompose the music to individual frequencies via Fourier Transforms (frequency domain) along with a waveform (time domain representation) and to train the model to learn when which notes are being played through either or both these domains. You would also need the model to uncover information about the start and end of each note, and which instrument each note belongs to (Not sure what data could be extracted to do this effectively but probably something that measures certain acoustics?) and maybe even predicting the beat or tempo of the song to further optimise the placement of the notes.   

Implementing this might be a little tricky. To assemble a dataset, you would need a lot of data (considering different styles, note ranges, tempos, instruments and so on) with pairs of audio files along with detailed transcriptions of the music. The model will likely have to have multiple parts which could be a combination of more traditional signal processing methods (Fourier Transforms, wavelet transforms, autocorrelation functions for pitch detection, and so on) and more DL-based methods (CNS for spectrometry if needed,  transformers (or RNNs) for time domains, MLPs or even traditional ML for instrument analysis). You could also maybe use some Reinforcement Learning to place the notes more accurately based on the beat, instruments and so on. Finally, you would need to be able to write some code to display this in your desired format.",-2

MachineLearning,"Between layers, the hidden state *is* of shape (B, L, E), where `E` is `D / 2`, because of the expansion factor of the input projection of each Mamba block.

`L` can also be folded rearranged into `B` (giving `(B*L, E)`, where `B*L` is the total number of new processed tokens across the batches) when outside Mamba blocks (and indeed, that's how it's done for Jamba which interleaves Mamba with Attention, MLP, and MoE. I know this because [I implemented Jamba this way in `llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/7531), and it worked).

It's only within the SSM that the hidden state has more dimensions.

`C` is the SSM output projection (contraction) matrix according to [the glossary in Appendix A](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.21060#appendix.A) of the Mamba-2 paper (because at least this is common between the two versions). `C` really is simply doing a row-wise dot product over dimension `N` (this is a matrix multiplication, but when fusing the operations it's easier to see as a row-wise dot product, which makes that dimension be contracted in the output (which does not have `N`). Remember that dot products take two vectors and return a scalar). I think what bothers you is that C is broadcast (constant/repeated/identical) over `D`.

Regarding interpretability, I think the Mamba-2 paper does a good job by making a lot of different approaches equivalent (and proving that). In Mamba-2, `x`, `B`, `C` are said to be equivalent to `V`, `K`, `Q`  respectively in the SSM/Attention duality (see [Figure 4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.21060#figure.caption.21)).

But in Mamba-2, `C` has shape `(B, L, H, N)` where `H` is the number of ""heads"", analogous to Attention heads. So in Mamba-1, `C` is of shape `(B, L, N)` because it has only one ""head"".",1

I don't agree - often in many smaller research labs, there are no ""engineering folks"" whose full time job is write kernels for you and fix your codebase.

This is the advantage of JAX as I laid out in the blog - you get autoscaling and optimization through `XLA`. You don't *have* to worry about the engineering side because XLA handles that automatically, no matter if you have 1x GPUs or a hundred distributed ones.

So you say that the shape of C is required such that our usual SSM update formulas are shapewise aligned?

I mean it is a bit counterintuitive that the hidden state is not a vector but rather a matrix (if we ignore the batch dimension). Could we not make the hidden state shape of \`(B,N)\` when the adjusted C is of shape \`(B,L,D,N)\`?

Otherwise, I think the hidden state is kind of hard to interpret. A common thing in math, however usually in ML I felt that the interpretability of the architecture choices were often something I could count on.

MachineLearning,"Hey this awesome, I will look into it! Question: Why OpenCL and not Vulkan?",10
MachineLearning,"> why are the input dependent shapes of B,C and Delta not of dimension (B,L,D,N)  ?

This is an interesting question because it's very fundamental to how Mamba is implemented.

For Delta (which I call `dt`) and B, it's relatively easy to explain, because `dt` has shape `(B, L, D)` and B has shape `(B, L, N)`, and together with an outer product they form `dB` (`B` with a bar in the linked figure) with shape `(B, L, D, N)`.

Recall that [the state update](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba/blob/62db608da60f6fc790b8ed9f4b3225e95ca15fde/mamba_ssm/ops/triton/selective_state_update.py#L258) is

`h' = (h * dA) + (dB * x)`

`h'` (the next state) after that point has shape `(B, L, D, N)`, because the state from each step over L is concatenated in this explanation.

Then `C` with shape `(B, L, N)` is used in a row-wise dot product to contract this into the output `y` of shape `(B, L, D)`.

~~`C` can't be of shape `(B, L, D, N)`, because it would not contract the states into the output in that case.~~ (EDIT: it could, but it would be slightly less efficient. This would be analogous to making a Transformer with `D` heads of size 1 instead of 1 head of size `D`)

The hardware-aware algorithm used to compute the selective scan avoids materializing the `(B, L, D, N)` tensors by fusing the operations together. (and by running the recurrence sequentially over `L` so that the intermediate states `h` have the shape `(B, D, N)`.)

See [`selective_scan_ref`](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba/blob/62db608da60f6fc790b8ed9f4b3225e95ca15fde/mamba_ssm/ops/selective_scan_interface.py#L91), which uses `(B, D, L)` instead of `(B, L, D)`, but it can also be implemented with `(B, L, D)`.",2

MachineLearning,"They're incredibly inefficient for things like finetuning and inference. Accelerate in special is a complete mess, you're much better off just writing your parallel setup from scratch. What sucks about this whole situation is that their huge presence in the ML space means many good libraries will design their APIs around them, see for example vLLM expecting HF format for models.

If you ever want to change anything about the inner workings of a model, navigating through the mess their model code has become is a nightmare. I think that at this point beyond being a repo for models and datasets, there is no reason to keep using HF. On this point, it should be mentioned that even as a repo for models they aren't that great, since they have some undocumented implementation choices that can result in signficiant headaches if you don't know about them.",5
MachineLearning,"The issue that I have with your article is:  
```
But in 2021 GPT-3 hit the scene and suddenly things started getting serious. All of a sudden, performance and scalability became the primary concern.  
```
Scaling is not research. Most researchers are not bothered about scaling. Fundamental research like coming up with a new architecture still requires researchers to play with very subtle and small set of codebases that contains extremely nuanced code. No researcher wants their codebase to be full of code related to moving data, allocating mem / GPUs, compiling ops, etc. etc. That is like writing a poem, with a huge boilerplate of ""how-to-read"" surrounding the poem. What researchers mostly want is that when they read their own (or someone else's) code back, they should be able to easily understand and comprehend the crux of the algorithm without any additional fuss like moving data to and fro gpu, compilation, etc. Researchers are not computer engineers and they don't want to be one. When a successful architecture gets discovered, then the scaling aspect can be handed over to the engineering folks who can anyway do a better job at allocating resources optimally and extracting the most juice out of a hardware. But for the researcher, they want to abstract it away as much as possible. And I believe that's why PyTorch has struck the right chord. PyTorch's inability to do what JAX does isn't a weakness. It is a strength. PyTorch was meant to be like this right from the start, and I am happy that it isn't moving away from this.",1
MachineLearning,"Unfortunately, the PyTorch deterministic mode doesn't guarantee determinism across machines. It only guarantees it on the same hardware and with the same software version, e.g. between runs on the same machine.",2
MachineLearning,">Really? By virtue of actually having documumentation they're already better than 90% of the competition. By virtue of having guides they beat 99% of the competition. 

Is this really the bar for one of the most popular ML library in recent history? Having documention at all? 

>The majority of use cases for the majority of users is always going to be running models and finetuning them. If you're looking to pre-train models, then sure, transformers is the wrong library for you. But it's no accident the library is as popular as it is. 

Well, one of the main selling points of HF was that you can create and train new models and publish them, including full on pre-training. So that is kinda of weird to say.

>I'm curious: Can you name all these other libraries that supposedly have better documentation than transformers? I saw some blogposts recently mentioning that Hugging Face have a technical writer employed working on the design and layout of their docs. That's a true 100x employee hire in our field if there ever was one. 

I find pytorch, tf, Jax to have much better docs than HF. I also find that many smaller libraries have better doc than HF. For the size and popularity of HF it has the worst doc in a ml library. If they pay more for people to improve their doc they should fire those people. They are wasting money.


>*Edit: With all this said, I myself tend to stay the hell away from pipelines and Trainer and other over-abstracted parts of HF libraries. It's not as bad when you write your own dataloaders and training loops, and that option is always open to you as a user.

Those are the main features of HF. If you stay away from them then you are proving my point.

Edit: spelling, grammer.",10
MachineLearning,"Yeah I'm glad it existed when starting out with local finetuning, since it took me a long time to wrap my head around implementations of concepts like attention, though at this point I'm running into experimental ideas which are too difficult to try with transformers/diffusers that it's probably worth ditching it and writing my own implementations.

That being said it's still great for a lot of stuff, e.g. I don't know exactly how gradient checkpointing is best implemented and if torch decides what to checkpoint or the caller, so am just using Diffusers to do it with a simple single call.",7
MachineLearning,"HuggingFace exists because it moved things forward. If they stopped adapting to new models, they'd have fallen behind. Yes I've encountered the duplicate functions, confusion and those issues. However it's not the worse thing in the world to realise that the decoding function or tokenizer is the same code across models, even if copy and pasted rather than an abstract class.

But look at what HuggingFace did with it's technique:

1) It enabled sharing the cutting edge BERT and later T5 models in Python with just a few lines of code and handled both download, and at the time basic inference, while allowing you to look under the hood enough to understand special tokens in BERT etc. The functions, at least early on, were named after the techniques they referred to in papers. They also had useful information on things like beam search vs auto regressive decoding around 2018 which was useful for the emerging NLP language model field.

2) The attractive online repository of model enabled sharing finetunes and more importantly upgrading/degrading to receive either better performance or better speed (e.g. with T5 sizes) on your projects

3) The deepspeed and other libraries inspired or related to HuggingFace, brought GPU support in an otherwise native-PyTorch only deployment world.

  
HuggingFace was an absolutely massive contributor to ML and made several jumps at once. In many ways they were a bit hard done by with GPT-3 coming out, since a lot of their efforts ended up not growing as much as they might have.

  
Trust me it's better now. In 2017, you had to train computer vision models in Matlab based on some caffe data file to get good performance, or for text models, you have a janky jupyter notebook (no GPU acceleration most likely!) with Word2Vec or GloVE or other code in a situation-specific abstract class you had to go and tinker with and apply PyTorch/PyTorch Lightning to on top. There was no easy way to say ""Here PyTorch, take this string, embed it with BERT model to extract embeddings, use that as input"". You had to specify the last layer, you also had to choose whether to use all layers during inference etc for quality of embeddings. All this work has been largely superseded by GPT-3 and sentence-transformers but it's still massive that they did this. Many of the classes/types of model which turned out not to be popular faded out and because of the avoid-abstract/generalising classes approach of HF, there are less terminology or code based vestiges of those when you run modern models which is great. The trade off is that code from very early models still remains in ways you wouldn't necessarily do from scratch.",18

MachineLearning,"Interesting, I had a similar idea to enforce equivariance using a regularization term. I was looking for literature on the subject and found your post.  I also found this article which uses a similar idea:

[https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00356](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00356)

  
I would have to look at the literature more but my guess is that using a regularizer to enforce equivariance is not very efficient in terms of training.  I would compare your technique with  augmentation and see which converges in validation faster.

Furthermore, most people don't use equivariant architectures on image spaces since augmentation will give you equivariance more easily.  Most work using equivariant nets, that I've seen, use them for physics problems where E3 symmetries  are explicit.  I would test your method on some of the datasets discussed in the papers here:

MachineLearning,"Existing compression schemes like zip, tar, and rar _are_ data agnostic. They work on the order of bits and can compress any file. The problem then becomes that you need to do a full decode before reading the data.

Lossy algorithms fix the decode problem by specifically using the domain of the file to engineer a way to more quickly unpack the data for playing.

It sounds like what you want to do is have an LLM generate a domain specific compression and matching decompression algorithm for any file spec it's given.

Which is, given current LLMs restriction to existing input and tendency to hallucinate, probably a poor use of the technology over existing applications.",2
MachineLearning,"`P` is simply `D / H` (and yes, `D` comes from the input projection and is twice as big as the embedding size when `expand == 2`). I think the linear recurrent portion of the code of Mamba-2 is a bit simpler to understand since you're already familiar with how Mamba-1 works.

How I see it, Mamba-1 has `H` equal to 1, and `P` equal to `D`. At least that's how the tensors are expanded in `selective_state_update` (which is used by both Mamba-1 *and* Mamba-2 in its linear recurrent mode).

Here's a small intuition about why: 

Lets start with just a hypothetical model phi420. Phi420 is completely nonsense and produces tokens randomly (its basically a rand(1, num tokens)). In this case, you can use a constrained generation technique like openai does with JSON mode, and it will technically produce parseable JSON. The JSON still doesn't mean anything useful even if its valid and matches the schema.

Parseable != useful

The implication that the model is able to output something close enough to a schema that we are able to parse gives the confidence that the model is able to understand the task / inputs.

More practical example: you are parsing a resume object from a OCR'ed PDF. however a user uploads an invoice pdf. Constrained generation will still output a resume, but parsing will correctly raise an exception.",3

MachineLearning,"> It has probably one of the worst documantion I have seen in a library.

Really? By virtue of actually having documumentation they're already better than 90% of the competition. By virtue of having guides they beat 99% of the competition. 

I personally find their documentation is quite comprehensive and well maintained compared to most of what's out there. Although I agree the amount of arguments can be confusing, their naming convention for code performing similar functionality across models/tokenizers/processors is commendably consistent (which helps a lot). 

The majority of use cases for the majority of users is always going to be running models and finetuning them. If you're looking to pre-train models, then sure, `transformers` is the wrong library for you. But it's no accident the library is as popular as it is. 

I'm curious: Can you name all these other libraries that supposedly have better documentation than `transformers`? I saw some blogposts recently mentioning that Hugging Face have a technical writer employed working on the design and layout of their docs. That's a true 100x employee hire in our field if there ever was one. 

From experience I have extremely low expectations of documentation in this field. Hugging Face far, far surpasses that low bar. Whenever I try to get something working off an Nvidia repo for example there's a 50/50 chance I end up wanting to kill myself. Looking at their repos I imagine they must spend tens to hundreds of millions of dollars paying top dollars to highly competent developers and engineers that develop open source code and models. For many of those libraries/implementations I never come across any examples or evidence of anyone on the internet having successfully used or adapted them. In my experience this tends to be the norm rather than the exception for most companies. 

Good developers and engineers generally aren't very interested in writing documentation that is readable and understandable below their own level. In fact, they're generally not interested in writing documentation at all. They're mainly motivated by solving problems. And documentation is something you write once a problem has already been solved. Writing (good) docs eats away time that could be spent solving new problems. 

I feel like there should be an xkcd comic for this. A plot with documentation quality on one axis vs developer skill on the other. I managed to go off on a tangent here at the end, but the main point I wanted to convey was that I find it quite strange that someone would find Hugging Face's documentation bad in this field. As compared to what exactly?

*Edit: With all this said, I myself tend to stay the hell away from `pipelines` and `Trainer` and other over-abstracted parts of HF libraries. It's not as bad when you write your own dataloaders and training loops, and that option is always open to you as a user.",4

Huggingface is successful from a product point of view because its a platform for models and low friction to the people dumping the models and weights which the uploaders spent the money and gathered the data to train are basically donating. The model uploaders are the people being the most generous to the platform. ML is done with many libraries especially earlier in HFs history when TF and torch where less lopsided in usage. This means the places where token operations happen can change wildly based on where the model uploader put it.

Adding more standardization would be nice to dev quality of life but it would come at the expense of friction to uploading models . This would be detrimental to the product as it would add friction to the model uploaders

MachineLearning,"Hugging face is a great library for doing simple things. Fine funning based on an uploaded dataset. generating text using a pretrained model, etc. It is a mess otherwise. 

1. It has become too big. HF tries to do too much. It started as way to share models. It has become a library for everything ML/DL related.

2. It is not consistent. You can find great code for models, but you can also find trash.

3. It has probably one of the worst documantion I have seen in a library. Many classes have so many arguments and similar named parameters it is hard to understand what they do. Many functions have subpar documantion. They give a sentence of what the functions/classes do, and sometimes nothing more. Usually with no example. Some features are not even properly documented.

I think hugging face is not made for researchers anymore. It is made for simple use cases. And it is great at that. Having a finetuned model in about 100 lines of codes is great. But usually more complex things are too hard.

Is it bad design? I don't know. I always thought hugging face was not made to have people play with configs and arguments, And for simple use cases it works very well. most of the simple things work with out using a single argument. If the was the design choice they made, then I could argue it has great design. It achieves what it wants to achieve. I don't think it was meant to have more complex use cases and if it does, it fails misrebly.",107

And by debug, I mean click to set a break point on a line,  click the debug button in your favorite IDE, hit the breakpoint, see the output of one of the layers of your network, and click step over to advance to the next line? If JAX can't do that it's a dead end. Ideally you can also run commands on your variables while paused.

MachineLearning,"Hey OP, interesting discussion on the application of LLMs in the medical field. In my experience, one key area where these models can be quite valuable is in clinical note summarization. We've had success using custom AI setups with Runbear, a tool that allows you to create highly specialized AI workflows in Slack. For instance, we use Runbear to manage and summarize patient notes, making it much easier for clinicians to access patient histories and keep records up-to-date without the cumbersome manual effort.

However, even with these implementations, it's crucial to maintain a human-in-the-loop approach to validate the AI's output to prevent issues related to hallucinations and inaccuracy. This integration has shown promise in supporting medical professionals rather than replacing their expertise. Interested to hear if anyone else has had similar experiences or pointers!",1

I’ve copy pasted the text from your post verbatim into the chatGPT app (gpt-4o) and it gives you the answer:

“It sounds like you’re referring to **spiking neural networks (SNNs)**. 

Spiking neural networks are a type of artificial neural network that more closely mimic the way biological neurons work. Instead of using continuous values for activation, like traditional neural networks, SNNs use discrete events (or “spikes”). The timing of these spikes is critical, and the neurons interact in a way that’s more analogous to the brain’s synapses, where the concept of “charge” or “potential” is similar to the membrane potential in biological neurons.

SNNs are part of the broader field of neuromorphic computing, which aims to replicate the behavior of the brain more accurately in artificial systems.”",6

MachineLearning,"Wow, that is unfortunate. Write to the area chairs to get their attention and point out you are have issues with this reviewer. We have done that before.",1
MachineLearning,"Thanks for the feedback! 

Yes, I thought about hybrid approaches or even a two-tower embedding model, but I wanted to start with something super simple. I wonder if many companies that use simple CF simply ignore positional bias.

Regarding randomisation, I would want to show random items in order to:

* Obtain training data for them otherwise they would never be seen. Newness factor works, but depending on how many new items are being added, some may never get seen, so I think we should also expose older items that just never got any exposure
* De-bias training data: if we train on data that is based on past recommendations, then our new model will always be conditional on our past recommendations

Thompson sampling is one way to achieve randomisation and I thought about it already, but perhaps it might be easier to get started with a simple epsilon-greedy approach",1
MachineLearning,"Yeah, you're right. It's a well-done paper. It's just extremely ambitious, so it feels like it falls short of the claim implied in the title.",1
MachineLearning,Haha yeah you’re right. What crazy times are these?,2
MachineLearning,"So for the positional bias i would say don't use pure collaborative filtering but a hybrid approach like LightFM and then introduce the position as a feature.

However that would leave the question of whether which items were next to those items in the carousel as a source of bias, you could do a graph model, those have come a long way recently but given your preference for simplicity at the start I would say lightfm.  
also I assume you have impressions and buy data as well right? (in that case map those ordinally).

Then for the exploration vs exploitation, I don't understand why you would want to show a random recommendation instead of a model based one? Is this because you think your model wont enable you to recommend new items?  
if that's the case, simply randomize the item profile, which items to show i would base on a weighted score, which consists of item newsness, item score (so how likely is that user going to click on it as predicted by your model, and inter item variance (so how different are the items from each other as determined by the euclidian distance between the items already in the carousel and the ones you're about to add). I would use a greedy optimisation algo to pick the items one after the other.

Then for the exploration and exploitation itself, you introduce thompson sampling to sample a mapping for the item newness factor (i would do a 2 parameter sigmoid) and then use bayesian optimisation to find the optimal parameters. But that's completely parametric, no switching between model and no model.

I hope this helps!",2

MachineLearning,"I'm in a very similar situation. It is a borderline score, so it can go either way, depending on the AC, reviews, reviewers and rebuttal... I guess we'll have to wait to the decisions. Don't lose hope, tho",1
MachineLearning,"A few things to consider that might produce a stronger model:

The height of the tree depends on the length of the input. If you have a single large model that has enough parameterized layers to accommodate a very long input, there are different approaches to dealing with inputs smaller than that very large maximum input size. One method is to pad the input to the maximum. Another method is to craft the layers so that you can just take a subset of them that can accommodate the input. 

I would argue that the subset approach is best, because it will let you get loss information from almost every token, allowing for *vastly* faster training of a large model. However, that means that intermediate nodes would be put to two different purposes: 

1. If the input is short, this intermediate node might be the top of the tree, which means it's expected to **produce the prediction** for the token beyond its rightmost child.
2. If the input is long, this intermediate node is likely to have a parent node, so the intermediate node will be expected to **usefully contribute to the parent node**.

For that reason, it might be worth making each ""node"" an MLP: perhaps taking the concatenated-left-and-right-children vector and expanding it up, say, four or eight times, then have two dimension-reducing heads sitting on top of that: one for consumption by the parent, and one for producing a prediction in case this node happens to be the top of the tree.

During training, you can use the outputs of the prediction heads *for every node N in the tree*, comparing those predictions against the token following N's rightmost child. That should supply rich gradient information, training the model faster.

Now, notice that the influence of a given token on that gradient signal depends on that token's position (especially, whether the token's position is even or odd), and that may be undesirable, so it may be appropriate to left-pad inputs by a random amount (at least, a random choice selecting zero or one, but it *might* help higher-level nodes to have padding randomly chosen up to the original length of the sequence).

So, all together, this suggestion is: make each node an MLP with an ""immediate prediction"" head and a ""contributor"" head, such that the ""contributor"" head is wired up to the parent; train on randomly padded inputs, with a loss that compares each prediction head with the token beyond the rightmost child for that head's node.",1

MachineLearning,"Won't work for language modelling, but maybe for specialised applications. Few reasons why:

- Your inductive biases go against everything that makes attention special. You're throwing away the ability to process a relational information-moving step between tokens of any distance. This gives very weak context ability and basically lobotomises everything good about attention. Might as well use an LSTM or RNN, since they also generalise better. Lastly, you are disallowing in-context learning to happen (see LLMs and induction heads).

- A corollary of the above: this will probably scale badly with model size, but I am not sure. I'd like to see experiments for this at varying scales up to a few billion parameters.

- No skip connections. This is a huge weakness, because tranformers' skip connections (the residual stream) allow every layer to talk to every other layer directly.

It isn't just big O that matters with ML models. You also need to care about how sample efficient it is with data and what scaling laws it abides by for the loss.",2

MachineLearning,">How do you think of a topic to work on? Do you have a general area you want to work on (eg. NLP, deep learning, etc.) and then you go over the recent work in important conferences (eg. \*CL, ICML, ICLR, NIPS) to try to narrow it down? Do you use any less formal resources like blogposts that you can recommend?

If you’re still figuring out what topic to focus on, I’d recommend subscribing to the [arXiv mailing list](https://info.arxiv.org/help/subscribe.html). By subscribing to the AI section, you’ll receive daily emails with around 100-200 paper abstracts. Occasionally, you might come across a title that piques your interest. When that happens, dive into the paper, try to understand the details, and consider potential extensions. This approach also helps you stay updated with the latest developments.

Another valuable resource is the feed on X (formerly Twitter). Start by following a few researchers whose work you find interesting. The platform's algorithm will then suggest similar content, often showcasing relevant research or discussions.

> How do you think of a definitions to formalize problems? Is it something that pops into your head after days of thinking or do you go through similar literature to find anything you can use? Also, how do you progress when doing proofs?

Regarding formalizing problems, here’s what I usually do—though I’m by no means an expert, having written just two formal-ish papers (only one in ML):

1. I start with an intuition about how something works, often stumbled upon by chance, that I want to formalize.
2. Then, I create a small script to demonstrate this intuition, which could be related to a specific neural network behavior. This step helps me gain a deeper understanding of the problem.
3. By this point, I usually have a good idea of what I want to prove, but I may not yet know how to go about it.
4. The proof process is somewhat chaotic for me, involving various strategies without a strict order:
   - I tackle the problem with pen and paper or on a whiteboard, both alone and with colleagues (even if they’re not in the same field). Explaining things in detail often reveals aspects I hadn’t considered.
   - I’m also open to modifying hypotheses and making helpful assumptions, anything to move forward. Even at some point I realize that one assumption made the overall proof useless or trivial. In this cases, I go back where I made that assumption and I try to weaken it.
   - If I find that my current approach isn’t working, I’m not afraid to step back or even set the problem aside for a while.
   - Sometimes, I find it helpful to physically walk around or bounce a rubber ball while thinking about the problem.

These are general suggestions, and everyone has their own unique approach to problem-solving.

Yes, for many of the cases the reviewers have good intent. However, there are countless other examples of Reviewer 2s that I don't think of any nice explanation for their behaviors.  I'm not sure they are trying to do all that they can either.",1
MachineLearning,ok I will do .,1
MachineLearning,"They're just referring to the causal mask. In PyTorch you can use torch.tril.

In a transformer, you calculate the dot product of Q and K transpose to get a resulting tensor of shape TxT, where T is the sequence length of the input.

You then apply softmax to that tensor to calculate attention. This is known as the attention matrix because it lays out how much attention each token should give to every other token in the sequence. 

In a model where you're doing some form of classification, then this fine as is. However, in an autoregressive model (like ChatGPT), tokens should only be aware of tokens that came before. Otherwise the model would be ""cheating the test"" so to speak during training, by looking at the answers before evaluation. 

To solve this, and enforce _causality_, we apply a _casual mask_. The most basic of which is the lower triangle mask mentioned in the paper.

The diagonal of the attention matrix represents a token's attention with itself. 

Any tokens to the right of the diagonal would be tokens from the future, so we multiply them by zero to remove that information.

On the other hand, tokens to the left of the diagonal represent tokens in the past, so we multiply them by one to preserve that information.",10

Second paper got only three reviews: 4, 5, 6. Seemed pretty borderline, but we managed to add some new experiments that the first reviewer asked for, and got the first two reviewers to bump up scores. So we ended at 5, 6, 6.

This year's experience was particularly bad for us as well. Initially we got 6654, we put _a lot_ of effort in the rebuttal but no reviewer engaged until 10h before the deadline (which was at night in our time frame so that next morning was... intense to say the least). Of course we got a couple of the notorious ""The review addresses my concerns. I keep my score"" type from the 6 and 5 reviewers. But we are here for reviewer 2 so let's go to the 4 score... The 4 was a reviewer that reviewed a previous version of our paper in ICML, ""how would you know?"" you might wonder... Well because even though we added quite some new results, experiments and comparisons, the review for NeurIPS was almost exactly the same (just changed the verbs for synonyms) than ICML's. After we explained that a lot of those things are not applicable anymore, addressed all his major concerns and even introduced a new theoretical result, 4h before the deadline he switched the focus of the rebuttal to needing to test with a rather obscure dataset that _no one_ has ever used for our task, said that ""even if it's not common we should use it"" and dismissed 4 *top-reference* papers that we used to explain that he/she was completely wrong on a (quite surprising) claim he/she made on the rebuttal by saying that ""they don't focus on our task"". One of this papers was the previous state of the art and they literally explain that they are addressing the problem of our task in the abstract, and several times throughout the paper. And as you can probably tell by now, of course reviewer 4 didn't change the score.

Another reviewer had a few tough questions and I followed up with empirical results and discussion. The reviewer ended up being satisfied with this and also raised my score. My lowest rated review did not have any follow up questions but did end up raising my score after my rebuttal. Only one reviewer did not respond at all to my rebuttal.

Overall, I felt like my review quality was pretty good. They all were quite detailed and seemed to point out legitimate issues, which I tried to address during rebuttal.

MachineLearning,"My motherboard has two PCI-E 3.0 slots that I can plug the 2 GPUs in. Each GPU also has a second connector (6 pin if I remember correctly). Each GPU draws power from both the PCI connector and the second connector. The power supply I have has enough cables that each GPU gets it's own cable from the power supply. I'm  not sure what problems would be caused by using a splitter to split one power supply output to 2 GPUs, probably limits for how much each power supply cable can provide.

I run Linux for my AI activities. Running two GPUs just works for me, no special setup required. Note that with LLMs, the data first flows thru layers in VRAM on the 1st GPU and then the second GPU gets the first GPU output to process thru the remaining layers. So speed is no faster than the slower GPU.

In Linux, you can still run a model with a single GPU by setting the CUDA\_VISIBLE\_DEVICES environment variable before starting your AI application. The environment would be set to CUDA\_VISIBLE\_DEVICES=0 or CUDA\_VISIBLE\_DEVICES=1 depending which GPU you wanted to use. This could be helpful in cases where the model is small enough to run on a single GPU, which in my case I would choose the RTX 4070 since it's faster, and leave the RTX 3060 completely idle.",1

Boiling this down to “but agricultural” hilariously abstracts away the complexities of an economic entity.  It just demonstrates a lack of familiarity with the field.

Automation has allowed many people to increase their marginal utility by not planting crops: sure. But the set of tasks that go to planting crops and the set of tasks that include (all the things that humans can do) is terrrribky small. 

However; just because an edge existed between one thing and another doesn’t imply this relationship holds at all points ever:  new edges come and go all the time.  And the marginal contribution to an edge to say, the expected value of something like marginal utility (or perhaps more generally, individual economic utility/ quality of life whatever) can change direction.

There is no debate: the rise of technology has accelerated the economic divide between the rich and poor. This translates to things like political capital and the like. The whole “but there will be more jobs because agriculture” line makes no sense: because being a farmer exists in a small subset of physical tasks a human can do. As the range of tasks is narrowed by ai: surplus labor conditions will continue to bottom out real wages.  And I’m not sure if you’re an American on unaware of its history; but labor relations in this country have been historically weak -with downstream effects like healthcare for the typical family being affected.

For instance: in Europe, unless you work for FAANG, there is a very clear upper ceiling you can hit with technical work career-wise (in like 90% of companies); and this is only avoidable if you work on soft-skilled positions (sales, management, customer-facing…)

I work as a manager for a DS/ML team in a classical company (imagine a bank, for instance). I basically do not do any technical work anymore (90% is bla bla bla and PPTs and politics), and I mostly keep myself up-to-date by reading papers and experimenting a bit myself in my free time. While I would not need it for my daily job, I cannot manage a ML team with a straight face without knowing my $#!t: I know how to fine tune a language model or how to plug in custom inductive biases in a neural net, or the math behind a Gaussian Process; even though most likely I won't be applying any of that ever again. Keep in mind that this is after 8 years of more technical roles.

well ok, but your Medium post says this:

Your model does *not* perform well on test. It is overfitting.

Semi-related, I would caution against the application of perplexity as a performance metric in this manner. Perplexity as a term (confusingly) is regularly used to refer to two separate but related concepts - a dataset has a perplexity that describes the entropy in the underlying probability distribution, and a probability model when trained on or applied to a dataset also has a perplexity, which is dependent on the agreement between the probability distribution underlying the data and the learned distribution captured by the model itself. When discussing perplexity scores of models applied to data (the second definition) - it is not technically correct to compare scores between different datasets. This is because one dataset may have a different perplexity (the first definition) than the other. Ideally, you would use a perplexity score only for comparing how well different models represent the data generating distribution underlying the same dataset; it cannot reliably be used to measure anything else.",27

MachineLearning,In my opinion the papers weren’t that good. The one with the two diffusion model doesn’t really fit its description. The ai said it would make a local and global model to get different levels of detail but the only difference between the two is that one has a linear layer before the regular mlp. The authors dismissed this as “not being able to explain your ideas” saying it was as good as a young researcher but I am pretty sure what the ai did had nothing to do with local and global structure. In other words the paper is be and they pretend like the ai did what it said but did not explain it instead of just making something that is unrelated.,2

The reason I find these results intriguing is that most models typically struggle to grasp nuanced aspects of human psychology, particularly writing styles over my case. Many models tend to overfit the training dataset, leading to poor performance on the test set.

In contrast, my model demonstrates strong performance on both the test and training sets. This might suggests that the model may have developed a genuine understanding of writing styles, rather than simply memorizing patterns from the training data.",-18

MachineLearning,"Thanks for the detailed response! I thought that you could define custom blocks as flax classes and turn them into keras layers quite easily. And you could define custom train steps directly with jax. If you can do that and fit it in keras decently easily (with just a little extra work to wrap everything inside), is there a case which you find would really hard (or harder) to wrap inside of keras?

What I used to like of keras, is that I can write lower level code to do the heavy lifting when there is no ready made function, wrap it in a custom layer, and then it would just work with everything else for which I don't need fine grained control (potentially), like dataset loading.

But I definitely understand the Occam's razor argument, for which why would you add boilerplate code on top when you can create everything directly with jax and flax, which was why I wrote this question to begin with.

After playing around with prophet I ended up with the Darts library https://hashbang.nl/blog/using-darts-timeseries-forecaster-to-perform-configurable-forecasting-on-timeseries. I like Darts a lot because it allows you to wrangle the data into a specific datastructure once, and then easily swap out the different models and make your code work for a specific usecase. 

If you are looking into automation, I found Argo Workflows to be a very nice companion to recurringly run these kind of forecasting jobs (https://hashbang.nl/blog/creating-an-mlops-pipeline-to-extract-forecast-and-load-timeseries-using-argo-cron-workflow-and-darts-timeseries-forecaster)",1

MachineLearning,"> It almost achieves perplexity near zero and 100% accuracy in predicting the next token. This happens in both the test set and the train set.

MachineLearning,"I have a few questions:

1. This just looks like an MLP applied on blocks of data... No state is preserved or updated between the blocks like in an RNN for exanple, is this correct? Essentially, this looks like a convolution.

2.There looks to be no casual making? So to make it a language model: you feed in n tokens, and predict the n+1 token. How is this parallelizable without a mask? since you literally have to wait for the next token then do the forward pass again to get the n+2 token. I didn't see this explanation.

3. If you feed in the full token sequence to make it parallelizable, then there must be a way to eliminate information from future tokens in the input affecting the past tokens, is there such a mechanism? Because then this might just simply be a data leak?

Apologies for the questions, its just difficult to understand the model because there is not mathematical formulaziation. Maybe you can tell us what are the inputs, what is the function being applied to the inputs, and then how the output is computed mathematically so that we can concretely give feedback.

The github repo wasnt any help either as I saw that you are loading pretrained models, so I cant actually see how the model is trained.",26
MachineLearning,"Would you mind clearing something up?

Let's say you have a batch of e.g. 8 tokens. You pass these 8 tokens through the tree of layers to get a single ""top"" vector. What (if anything) do you do to that ""top"" vector to make a prediction, and what specifically are you predicting? The simplest answers to these questions, I guess, would be ""the top vector *is* the prediction, and it's a prediction of the ninth token""... would that be correct?",3

MachineLearning,"Someone mentioned - do you use masking?
Second question is how big is your neural network that you are using between layers. 
I will definitely appreciate your idea. However, again as someone mentioned linear transformers exist and they are not as good as the softmax ones. 
Here's what I will ask you to think about - the flow of information is a very vague term. RNNs have flow of information. What's important is to understand whether information is not lost. For example say the 1st and the 10th token are related. Now when they actually meet somewhere at the upper layers can you ensure that useful information is not lost? May be you need to do synthetic experiments like associative recall type tasks or find theoretical evidence that information is not lost. 
Lastly, think about this - say instead of a binary tree, I take all the tokens into a matrix and then multiply it with another matrix and pass it through a non linearity. Aren't we doing token mixing this way as well? This is similar to MLP mixers. 
Transformers work so well because of a lot of underlying reasons which we don't know. If you are really interested in actually beating transformers, look into why transformers work so well first (or at least what people have been able to understand so far).",11

I think explicit memory is something essential if you want the model to work beyond its limited context size, which should be treated as short-term memory anyway.",2

MachineLearning,"Hey guys, i think this website can be great for you to find more useful use case

The platform is called [strt.ai](https://strt.ai) -> basically a community where members post use cases for AI,  and businesses can connect eith them. All information is use case oriented and then you can find a list of tools that apply.

From an Al Expert point of view you basically showcase your expertise by publishing these use cases and you build your “Al portfolio”, then you can get visibility from businesses that view your use cases (specially if your solution stands out), and end up connecting with companies.

Hope it helps!

MachineLearning,"Because the models are going to hallucinate. AI generated papers makes no sense because it defeats the purpose of peer review and independent inquiry. How can we be sure anything is real if we rely entirely on LLMs to generate and review everything? The answer is that we cannot. 

It isn't like using AI to write parts of your paper, which is not really that big of a deal I guess besides it making your paper verbose (and thus annoying to read). This way of automated research circumvents the scientific method and is thus a waste of time (because it fails to do the task that has been set out for it).",1

May be a minor point, but the fact that there's a difference between the guidance and what's in OpenReview might matter.

Coupled with the fact that there weren't specific reviewer guidelines this year (I was given a link to the main track), I'm sure the overall ratings are a little off. I've definitely seen other reviewers penalize papers for issues that are irrelevant for D&B, for example criticizing single-blind submission (the default and explicitly allowed) or not reading supplementary info (in the main track, ""you don't have to"").",2

MachineLearning,"So we have 6654.  TLDR was that we didn't have much luck and no scores changed, haha.

1. The 5 had a confidence of 1, and never responded/followed up to our rebuttal.
2. The 4 pushed back pretty strongly on our rebuttal with saying some assumptions we had relied upon as being shown in prior/cited work were not re-verified. But I think we suggested fairly convincingly that you can't reprove everything in a paper. (And they had one valid complaint about our experiments showing rather low accuracy, which I can admit.)
3. One 6 gave a positive response that we'd addressed any concerns/questions they had and they're excited to see further progress. Very similar to your ""4"" review. Didn't update the scores numerically but to be fair a 6 is already fairly high, and certainly the tone of their review and comment was good.
4. The second ""6"", we answered all of their complaints/questions in their review (which they didn't acknowledge). But they said having read the comment by 4 about relying on assumptions from prior papers, they decided they had similar concerns and wouldn't update their score. (And after not having mentioned any of these concerns in original review.)

I'd say we're about a 10-20% chance of accept, and depending on how convinced the AC is by our arguments.",2

A decision to 'hold' for example represents that a model has determined that there's a reason not to sell, but that doeant mean theres a reason not to BUY the stock.

It will depend on bank roll and other evaluations of future risk.

I guess in the case of say RL for winning video games, if a model only knows ""UP"" as a means to win a game, it mosrlt likely wont be able to achieve the goal, but if it knows ""UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT"" it's more useful.

There are a handful of people with nearly perfect memory (HSAM) and they typically function well in society. Some studies point to them having higher rates of OCD (and some show the opposite) but LePort et al. (2012) says it is possible/likely there is a common underlying mechanism causing the OCD and HSAM, rather than the HSAM causing the OCD. This indicates that there is no reason to strongly believe anxiety and OCD are inextricably linked to longer memory.

Also, would suggest not breaking mid-word if possible for readability.

MachineLearning,"So the ""crunch"" is determined by the transient mainly + sustain.

Idea:

Instead of working with spectrogram, for each sample, set a compressor with high treshold, low attack and long release -> Pass the samples through this -> Record the Peak/Compression Reduction/sustain time (If compressor is set to auto) for each millisecond/some small time period (Can we get more useful info from this?).

Use that data as tabular and slap some unsupervised clustering on it.

In theory, because crunch is determined by transient and sustain, sudden compressor cuts should indicate strong transient -> the squishy ones should be barely noticed.

Also, dont forget to volume normalize the samples beforehand.",1

MachineLearning,"Oh, I also think this is very important.",1
MachineLearning,"Good luck with it. The other algorithms are unsupervised but powerful methods to do similar tasks. It's possible that you can identify a hyperplane but I doubt it will generalize. I also think you will have trouble defining the hyperplane in the first place. The components of the vectors are unlikely to be linearly independent with respect to features you are interested in. Your approach (defining some directions as words) doesn't seem likely to produce results, imo.

You may actually be better off to manually label every chunk based on structure (or whatever you don't want UMAP to use to make neighborhoods) and then use PCA on the embeddings to see if some of the components are closely aligned with the labels you added (spearman's rank) and then eliminate them before UMAP.

Vector -> word is extremely common. LLMs do feature extraction and then infer on it. Classification using transfer learning from a representational model is similar.

I think your idea of ""taking the second half of a LLM"" has practical limitations that will make it nonviable.

Edit: don't know how I forgot this but are you still using OpenAI's embeddings? They are quite limited. Shop the huggingface embedding leaderboards and try some of the high performing, smaller ones for feature extraction. I really believe that instruction accepting ones can solve your ""over extracted structure"" problem with something as simple as a prompt.",1

I do fairly theoretical, rigorous work so I try to write my abstracts in such a way that anyone who can't handle long derivations and pages upon pages of math is unlikely to bid on my papers.

DataAnalysis,"Two different questions there in my opinion.  Size of the laptop, and cheaper vs. gaming.  On size of the laptop, there isn't all that much difference in price based on size these days, and it is more a personal choice.  Some people prefer smaller laptops.  I prefer larger screens and don't care about the weight differences in what is commonly available today, however there may be some screen sizes that are big enough to be inconvenient to use in some classrooms given desk/seating arrangements if you are able to use your laptops in class.    

For DA studies, there usually isn't a significant advantage to the extra spend for a gaming computer instead of something cheaper that is still Windows, SSD, 16-32GB RAM, and i5, i7 or AMD equivalent.  Most of the cost difference is in having a separate high grade GPU in gaming computers and that isn't a need that comes up generally in DA studies programs.",4

DataAnalysis,"I've been on Datacamp long enough to comment. While they offer various career paths, the exercise I hate the most is fill-in-the-blanks, which doesn't help much if you are trying to master anything. Of all the courses offered, SQL has these fill-in-the-blanks. A few JOIN statements are way too confusing, with just a 2-minute video followed by a fill-in-the-blanks exercise, which doesn't serve any purpose to me. You might want to look into the Dataquest platform for in-depth content, but I think it is a bit pricey. You also have Analystbuilder and Maven analytics.",1

DataAnalysis,Thank you!,1
DataAnalysis,"Well, I always prefer centralization of data, but it really depends on the company. With centralization you get homogeneous data across the company, a single source of truth, the ""one KPI"" everybody knows off and works towards. Also creating reporting that encompass different aspects of the company instead of individual reporting, and a team that talks to each other so everybody knows somewhat of the different areas.

Decentralized is the easiest route. You have a reporting/data need in a business unit, you add a data guy over there. He becomes an expert of that area, but then he doesn't have a global picture. 

Centralization can have its own issues, like disconnection from areas that should be supported, and less touch with the day to day work. If you attend every daily and team meeting of the area you support, you'll be much more aligned with their struggles than if you support them through requirement gathering coming from the data team. 


When it comes to data itself, data architecture, I'd rather have everything on one place.",3

DataAnalysis,"I'm about a week into the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. I have no formal experience, but I'm trying to break out of call center prison and squirm my way into Workforce. The entry level positions are pretty much on rails and the workflows are pretty teachable. Most of the applicants are people in my boat, since it's a call center and everybody's shoving over each other to gtfo the phones. I'm just spamming my resume with whatever the fuck I can to show I'm serious about the role.

I can't speak for the full course because I'm not very far in, but I can't stand most fucking courses I take. They invent or subscribe to terminology that only seems to exist for the sake of the course, but then their quizzes are just callbacks to the phrasing they used.

""Jim is looking through last month's sales data to see how old the customers are. He sorts each customer into three age groups. What phase of data analysis is Jim currently in?

A.) Identifying Trends

B.) Searching For Patterns

C.) Categorizing Things

D.) Sorting The Data""

They're not quizzing you on anything other than the phrasing and terminology they decided on earlier in the course. Go onto Google and search ""What are the phases of data analysis?"" There is no end to the results, and no two are alike. It's just pages and pages of different courses or articles saying the same thing, but quizzing you on precisely how they said it.

I'm still going to finish the course, because I'm still learning and developing muscle memory as I do the exercises. And that certification, not unlike a degree, communicates that I put the time in to complete the course and maybe the other guy applying didn't.",1

DataAnalysis,"If you're talking about courses that charge you hundreds, or even thousands of pounds, then absolutely not.

Here's my take on it. If you've never done any kind of data analysis and want to see if you'll enjoy it, take a course on Udemy for Excel or Power Bi when they're on a discount (it'll cost you like £15). I'm not trying to plug any course here, but any from Marvin Analytics are quite good. You get a dataset, they walk you through what and why you're doing something and you end up with a finished result like a cool looking dashboard. 

This is will give you a relatively good understanding of what you'd likely end up doing in the workplace.

At the end of the day, no matter what tool you use, you'll be accessing data either via a database/warehouse/csv file etc , cleaning it so you can build visuals of some kind,  conduct you analysis to gain insights, then likely continuing to track them in the future. 

After that, it's literally just picking up different tools that fit the job and reading documentation. 

As long as you can perform those tasks, you're half way there in my opinion.",1
DataAnalysis,"I don't think AI will take away our job anytime soon. in fact, it will only transform our job for the better.

I was a business analyst for a large tech company. I learn that business leaders relies on me for insights, not data. When they approach me with questions, they are not really asking for the numbers. Quite the contrary, they are only asking 2 questions: 

1) Are we ok as a team

2) If we are not ok, what should I do

Coming back to your question, all AI could provide are the numbers, and descriptions. Can AI provide the empathy, professional guidance, and confidence? I highly doubt so.

Therefore, I'm pretty optimistic with the direction of AI. AI will take away the more operational task,  freeing analysts to answer the more strategic, complex and impactful question.

We will be fine.

DataAnalysis,Online courses are really good as a starter. There are few good intermediate level courses too. I haven't found any good advanced level course.,1
DataAnalysis,"Absolutely, although it depends exactly what you're interested in. I faced this exact problem when I was looking for analytics-focused roles after my psych undergrad so I know where you're coming from. You might struggle to find something that blends psych and sociology however. 

Becoming a researcher will give you the most latitude in terms of topics to analyse but it comes at a cost. Academia has a high barrier to entry, isn't often well paid and offers little job security. On top of that, you probably won't have much contol over what you study/analise since you'll largely be expected to contribute to existing department topics that are tied to funding until you start bringing in your own.

I personally work in public health so my work touches on population statistics, behavioural modelling and health policy. Other public sector roles like offices for education policy, energy and trade, environment/farming are also increasing looking for analytics talent so your options are certainly ooen. Of course, these roles also come with downsides too - pay being one but less so on the job security front.",1

* **Certificate**: Evidence of completing a program of study.
* **Certification**: Proof of passing an exam or meeting industry standard",2
DataAnalysis,"... With your experience I don't get why this would be hard? Is the issue the forecast aspect?

Okay first start off establish the history:

Sales date - aggregate by week

products - group by product

Sales numbers - sum

Trend this week over week. Do it visually if you need to. and seperate lines for each product and total. 

Take a hard look and watch for any trends. Does Product X go up in December because of Christmas? Does product Y go down in september? Do all products surge for half the year? etc. 



To forecast you need to make a model and use the assumptions from history to help decide. Just pretend that a person came to you and said, ""Square Square, Circle Square Square"". Next pattern is ""Square Square, Triangle, Square Square"". Even with just 2 series you can effectively give a decent guess the next one. All you are doing is copying is that into the future with numbers. You may have NOTHING. and that is fine. you then tell them that there is no noticeable trend. Perhaps there's a another variable not captured that is impacting sales? Maybe it is truly random? But because it's a employment test you probably won't have this outcome. 

1) Are sales cyclical by month/season/etc? 

2) Are sales contantly trending up year over year?

3) are some products acting differently? Perhaps summer months X product is better? In winter Y product is better?

Use these assumptions to build forecast. Perhaps every year you notice that sales go up total 5%. Then add that into the equation. Take last year's data and multiply that shit by 1.05. Perhaps in winter months, Y product goes down 30% one year, and another year 20%. Then make a function that reduces Y product by 25% in winter months. 

  
There are way more complex AI models you could throw it like a time series SARIMA/ARIMA type thing but this looks like a rudiementary test to make sure you are factoring all considerations. Just do that.",15

It seems like if your resume is interesting enough and you have a good cover letter they could still hold some sort of interest in you and pull a few strings",3
DataAnalysis,"I think it’s all about your current situation and how you plan to use the cert. Coming from a totally unrelated field might not allow the course to carry the weight you anticipate. 

Mine was through an accredited 4 year university, all online for 6 months. I learned a lot and really used it to network with my professors and classmates. I was in a data adjacent role so I used the new experience from the bootcamp to improve my role there and then used it to get my first 100% data focused role. I think it all depends on what course you choose and you absolutely have to have a plan for networking and creating a unique portfolio after the course is over.",1

DataAnalysis,"The google course on coursera is great for a broad understanding of the multitude of skills required to be a data analyst.
Do that course then get to the specifics of what you want to learn in more detail/depth.
Then get a portfolio, I think this is the most important thing, even more than a degree etc.
That’s what I am doing anyway, half way through the google course as well as some python data analysis specific courses.",3
DataAnalysis,Im currently on an Apprenticeship. This is government back and has a solid certificate at the end of it. We use Datacamp for all the learning. Each session the tutor will set assignments on data amp and when done we upload the certificate. That is part of the proof needed for our course.,1
DataAnalysis,"In your case and skillet, it's best to use Excel, as suggested by them. 
Many companies / departments have a good understanding of excel and lean on this tool, so they can make sense of your thought process when you setup some nice sheets to analyze the data and then do a forecast.

Depending on the data and granularity they provide try to play with the dates and look for seasonalities, trends over weekdays, public holidays etc. Make some graphs / pivots to do that and get a good understanding on what might impact sales. They are asking you to do a forecast for a full year, so these will usually be reoccurring effects. 
Also try to look for trends (e.g. uplift YoY or monthly trend) to include in your calculation. 

If they provide cost data, try to see how that relates to the sales / revenue trends. Calculate efficiency / roi and see how they are trending and how they impact the sales performance. 

They provide products. So also split your analysis mentioned above to these products (so that you have a high level overview and by-product overview of the trends). 

Then, depending on your results, you can either use excels regression / trend functionalities for forecasting, including modifiers for your calculation or just use fixed modifiers on the previous year as provided by the trends you see, to do a calculation. 

Provide your results both in tables and some graphs to show your calculation VS. the previous year(s). 

The last question is highly dependent on the line of business you are applying for. Not much can be said about that without any background info.",3
DataAnalysis,"I agree the Google course feels like a very brief intro to the topics covered.

DataAnalysis,"I really like Edex courses for their depth of content. And you don’t have to pay unless you want the certificate. I learned a lot from their Harvard Data Science track. The R basics class in particular was excellent. I’m not sure how useful the certificates would be in terms of getting a job. It might not be worth it to pay, and better to just learn the material for free and develop some good quality projects afterwards or get an internship or volunteer to show some actual experience. Oh and for SQL, I found the SQL for dummies book a good start.",3
DataAnalysis,"Doing online courses is better than doing nothing. I had my master degree but honestly i do the degree because society still values it. I knew i pay for the recognition and the curriculum and alumni network and that’s it. 

Most of my learning are supported by online courses, their quality is a lot better than 90% of colleges in my subjective opinion. They are often visually more appealing and content is more up-to-date. For one subject there are many different courses you can choose from with different teaching approaches, you can choose one that maximizes your understanding. 

If you want to learn and gain some advantage in job application, consider professional certificates. More importantly, just as you see many graduates fail in life, learning is not sufficient to be successful, it’s how well you generate value to companies from what you learn.",11
DataAnalysis,I messed up on the resume portion of the application and forgot to add the essay prompts. Is there anyway to reverse the application to redo the application or will updating my careers profile update my application?,2
DataAnalysis,"Yes they are, you just have to do technical business projects after you do a course or apply what you learned in one of your projects. But if you are trying to get a data analysis with no type of formal college education its going to be a long shot. Have a portfolios and net work. Look into cheap online schools like WGU.  These online courses are used as ways to demonstrate knowledge to gain entrance to masters degrees of course they are worth it. 

Cant be lazy and just watch a couple tutorials and think you are going to get on the job training. You have to do industry relevant projects, net work, and build a nice resume, portfolio, github profile. Completing the courses by themselves have damn near 0 value because tons of people cheat and just click through the courses for a certificate so you have to demonstrate by doing to a hiring manager you are worthy of a high paying job. Basically you are going to have to do a lot of work and networking. 

Also you just missed it but google had apprenticeships for people just like you those are designed to give on the job training to people wet behind the ear. [https://apprenticeships.me/](https://apprenticeships.me/) this site has tons of apprenticeships and Microsoft leap might start accepting applications in September.",5
DataAnalysis,"Online courses are very diverse in terms of utility and the value potential employers will see in them. You can learn a lot from free courses like those from Google. However, in my experience, the reality is that most employers don't view those as real training or experience in the field. It looks good on your resume if you already have a job in analytics, but it's not likely to get you your first job (at least imo). When you pay for a course you're essentially paying for the credibility of the course, not the content. 

For example, years ago I had no analytics experience and a degree in a non-technical field. I did a 6 month course that was administered by Trilogy Education but branded as the University of Texas. Very much not free lol. Even then, it took me months to even get a single interview and luckily I got that job - I had no other prospects. The important thing is to get that first job that will give you the title, and after that you can do whatever. But it's easier to get that first job (again, imo) when your courses *seem* legit.

That said, at the time, I don't think I knew any more or less than someone who did a free course either.",29

DataAnalysis,"I did the google course and I felt like I didn’t learn enough. They teach you the most basic stuff for multiple different programs (SQL, R, Tableau). I have found DataCamp to be a lot more useful skills and go more in depth about each program.",37
DataAnalysis,👌🏻,1
DataAnalysis,"DataCamp is a solid choice! It’s structured to cover a range of skills and tools that are essential for data analysis, including Python programming, data manipulation, and visualization. The mixed opinions you've seen are likely due to different learning preferences—some people thrive on interactive platforms like DataCamp, while others prefer a more traditional approach or deeper dives into theory.

Also add StrataScratch as another valuable resource for learning and practicing data analysis, particularly if you're interested in developing your skills for technical interviews and real-world data problems.",1

DataAnalysis,agreed! It doesn’t hurt to apply. You never know 😁,3
DataAnalysis,Yes I did,1
DataAnalysis,"For a non-code, user-friendly approach to extracting data fields from multiple PDFs into a single Excel or CSV file, check out [PanaForma](https://www.panaforma.com/) for Windows. With the data in a CSV you can then load it into a dataframe and go from there. PanaForma also has a bulk processing feature, so 100+ PDFs would not be a problem.

It works great with collections of PDFs that follow a consistent page layout, so hopefully that's what you're working with. Good luck!",1
DataAnalysis,You can apply! I don’t think it should be a problem,2
DataAnalysis,Do you guys think I would be ineligible to apply if I have a bachelors in Political Economy... its not directly related to data analytics but obviously has exposure to some basics of it.,3

DataAnalysis,"Great project and easy-to-understand explanation. 
Btw, how can you find dataset related to detailed operation of business like this one? I want to know cause I want to do a project solving real-life problem also",3
DataAnalysis,"I have been a recruiter for over a decade - and from what I have seen, many data analysts have had to submit over 150 resumes and go through 5-15 interviews to land their first job. It gets really competitive, but I have some tips for you!  
  
First, use your diverse background to your advantage. Highlight how your marketing experience can give unique insights into data analysis, such as understanding consumer behavior or market trends. We really appreciate candidates who bring new perspectives to the table.  
  
Next, make sure your LinkedIn profile and portfolio website are top-notch. Also, mention any real-world projects that can set you apart from other candidates.  
  
Next, network - reach out to former colleagues, attend industry meetups (virtual or in-person), and connect with data professionals on LinkedIn. Sometimes, it's not just about applying to jobs but also about who you know and who can vouch for you.  
  
Lastly, consider getting some updated certifications in data analysis tools if you have not already. This lets the recruiters know that you are proactive about learning!  
  
Keep pushing forward, and don't be afraid to put yourself out there.  
  
Good luck!",1

You can create a data warehouse for historical data. Using upsert method (update insert). The logic is you will need one primary key (either an actual primary key, datetime or combination of column) that will be unique for each rows. 

Create a temp table for each new day (you can just use one table) or insert per row (this will not be efficient for big data or cost per row method like cloud data base).

and then check if value of this new key in temporary table = historical data. If not add new else update.

Create > feedback 🔄 improve


1- Look for a real life problem that you can solve or atleast explain using data related to it. Crime, sales, literacy rate etc

2- Find its dataset or use an API or scrape it from web

3- Explore dataset and see what kind of data it holds,  columns, data types, null values, min/max

4- now create questions that you are going to answer using this data (describe your data to chat gpt and ask for sample questions)

5- Now you play with data, use excel for both data cleaning and visualization. Then try this with PowerBI or tableau. Then SQL + any viz tool. Then python. Just google or chat gpt how to do XYZ and do that. Need to find maximum number? Google how to find maximum number in excel/sql/python.

Try to implement your solutions in all tools. Create simple visualizations, remember your goal is to provide insights (fancy stuff carries very little value)

 (You dont have to get it right in the first attempt, you'll fail thats normal. Dont hesitate in googling stuff you dont understand)


6- Document every step using an editor like MS word .(youtube is your mentor, learn how to document your project from beginning to end). Starting with problem statement, add other sections as you proceed.

(Share it in public groups and ask for feedback, then improve. 🔄 Repeat this a few times)

DataAnalysis,"If your goal is to find a job quickly, I think it would be beneficial to get more material dedicated to a specific domain. Courses you see online are designed for a wide audience. Since this is just for you, it should be more specific to your needs.

In terms of the rigor of your curriculum, I think you need more developed requirements for your projects. I think you would also benefit from bringing in more high-level concepts, like stats and linear algebra, project management, project finance, data management, and architecture. As a junior professional, these topics will be above your pay grade but you need to demonstrate understanding of these concepts in order to advance into more senior roles. Better to start that early and give yourself more context to learn from throughout your career. I think you should supplement each of your modules with a textbook and 4x the videos and articles. I think you should find a way to get more critical feedback. 

I think you should model your curriculum more closely to a Masters program in Business Analytics. You should clearly identify your desired outcomes of each module and make sure there is enough material to actually meet those goals.",7
DataAnalysis,"Hey  , thanks for the feedback! I think we can make a better offering based on feedback from technical users like you and also refine our pitch.

The goal of this tool overall is to reduce time to insight. Having been a technical consumer of data at a large company (let's say there are hundreds of tables), there are plenty of times where I have trouble identifying the right tables and columns and had to Slack people, search Alation, etc. to find where to look. We approach this finding step in a similar way to how an analyst would do it, but with an automated and explainable approach that should save time.

I agree that given the right table schemas, ChatGPT can make a query. We have additional context from places like BigQuery and Looker to help get to a (hopefully) correct query quickly that would be hard to locate and paste in efficiently. Because we're hooked into BigQuery, we can debug the query until it is running and you can check the data returned within our tool to make sure it looks right. The analysis step is an added benefit that we'd like to improve on. The same run and debug until it's right approach is used in this case as well.

Happy to answer any other questions or respond to any other feedback!",-3
DataAnalysis,"So my main issue with tools like this is that if you have the requisite knowledge of what data analysis is and a basic understanding of your goals in a given analysis, all of the things this copilot is doing could be done easier by making direct requests with existing LLMs. If I have a dataset that I have properly done my eda on and learned how it fits, which I would assume any real data analyst would be doing, I would just ask the model for a specific request such as “give me the SQL query for XXXXX” or “give me the python code to make a scatter plot of XXXXX and YYYYYYY using matplotlib” etc. the fact that this tool can do these things is great, but if you’re working at a level where you can actually benefit from this kind of analysis I would assume you already know enough about what you’re doing to where it would be more efficient to just make direct requests to pre-existing models. 

What’s the draw for someone who is reasonably competent already to use something like this over say the paid version of ChatGPT?",28

DataAnalysis,"I think the well-defined part comes from my experience and how I approach tasks. I have almost zero guidance how to approach my role.

I am a Learning Technologist. I have an undergrad degree in Interdisciplinary Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, a masters in Biotechnology, and did significant further training and education for coding, but in a non-traditional school. Career wise I spent more than a decade as an educator, including building curriculum. I built a program and taught remote for 4 years-prepandemic in a flagship program that was very successful.

My original job description is pasted below and I put whether or not I actually do this task in parentheses. I think there is such a large disparity because this role was open for over 18 months and the HR person said if they did not hire me, he would close the role because he was fed up with my team’s extreme indecisiveness, that other people ended up doing a lot of what they hired me for because it couldn’t wait 18 months to get done.

- Manage, re-configure, improve and maintain COMPANY eLearning and virtual learning technologies
using advanced technical knowledge of back-end processes, connections, and systems
integrations (false, someone else already does this)
- Independently research learning trends, and recommend and advocate for new virtual
learning platforms and emerging technologies (i.e., Virtual reality, augmented reality,
gamification, etc.) (false, someone else already does this)
- Play a key role in collecting and interpreting virtual learning feedback and productivity data
using sophisticated analytical thought and tools to recommend updates and enhancements to
learning technologies, methodologies, and processes (true-ish)
- Monitor team processes, recommend, and implement best practices to automate or streamline
workflows and foster efficiency (lol, no one listens to me, they just like to roll how they roll)
- Independently manage and administer virtual classroom platform and vendor relationships (false, someone else does this)
- Manage virtual learning vendor relationships (false, someone else does this)
- Research and recommend virtual classroom implementation best practices and develop and
document support procedures (I have this experience and skill set, 10 months into it, I have not been tapped to do this)
- Manage virtual classroom scheduling (nope, this was handed off to another team before I arrived)
- Research and create virtual learning system technical requirements (I don’t even know what this means)
- Draft virtual learning system documentation (lol)
- Coordinate and orchestrate systems maintenance and upgrades (one time,for a decommissioning)
- Provide eLearning and virtual learning support to different segments of COMPANY agents as well as
Development Manager population (nope)
- Monitor performance of virtual classrooms, report on activity, monitor, communicate, and
analyze virtual classroom feedback and make recommendations for improvements (eh, I create surveys using best practices along with reports (Qualtrics), the managers have yet to look at them)
- Create and deploy new virtual classrooms using advanced knowledge of virtual learning
practices (not at all, someone else was hired to do this)
- Schedules, produces, and communicates analytics for COMPANY Virtual Classrooms and
webinars (Nope)

Within 2 months of being hired, I solved something with Excel that the team had been stuck on for 2 years and that almost totally changed my role and responsibilities overnight to be far more data focused. Additionally, the company began tracking OKRs, and I became the person to run the reports. We also partner with a college, and I ended up doing a study that looked at success metrics comparing people who completed at least one of their programs vs people who did not, as part of a bigger study where the college asked this of all their corporate partners.

I also build automations using Power Automate/Power Apps.

The talent acquisition agent actually reached out to me about this role. I would have never thought to apply for it. I am as surprised as anyone that I landed this job.",1

But this year’s job posting says nothing about certifications in the description. It says that the only thing that would disqualify you is if you have a degree in data analytics or professional experience in data analytics. So I think you are okay.

However, keep in mind that the learning portion of the apprenticeship is basically completing and obtaining that certificate. So being that you already have it, it could disqualify you. But I say apply anyways and see what happens because you never know. The worse thing that could happen is that they just reject your application because you have completed it already.

DataAnalysis,"I’ve been on two extreme spectrums of this role. Started off with uber where SQL ofcourse was at the heart of it and if you’re feeling creative you could utilize python to build sophisticated models however its not a must for majority roles. Currently I’m with a big insurance corporation as a data analyst and they have a lot of legacy issues like using macros and stuff. Since average age in my team is 38-40, they get super impressed by using excel shortcuts. All in all, I would say going to grad school for data analytics will not be a very wise decision. 

A bit more context, i did a few basic sql courses in 2017 right after my business undergrad to land my first role at uber as a data analyst. 20-30 hours of effort online will give you enough to talk and claim that you know sql and then it really depends on your networking game.

DataAnalysis,"Hi u/Daytona116506 I want you to try out [sqlpilot.ai](https://sqlpilot.ai)

I think it will solve your problems, it has knowledge base support, you can label your database tables and columns, so that the llm knows what table does what. you can also add examples in knowledge base, so the sqlpilot picks up relevant examples matching your query and sends it to llm along with your query. and along with this you can also add custom instructions to the llm, so that it knows how some things are done that only you know as data analyst

I have kept the tool free to use, you just need to put your Open AI key. if you don't have Open AI key, sign up with account, you will get some free credits, i will add more if you want.

It works locally, you can connect your database using creds

let me know how it goes!",1
DataAnalysis,"Hi! Google says nothing about attaching transcripts to your application in the description. All they say to do is attach one resume file that includes your essay responses. I have seen from previous Reddit threads of the previous years that sometimes Google will end up emailing you for more information if needed before sending the questionnaire. From what I found it was never about transcripts. It was mainly for confirming dates for how long you attended school. 

But for now, I do believe all you need is the resume and your essay responses. And it would be best to follow exactly what they ask of you to do in the description to show that you read the whole description and followed direction.",1

DataAnalysis,"The standard approach is to figure out the adjusted price elasticities for different segments. Use K-means for getting the segments first from your demographic customer data. Since your areb likely global, you need to adjust prices be purchasing power of each country. If you run many promotions you need to adjust the demand by using weights representing reach. After that you create a prices (from the various discounts) vs demand (weighted) curve. Ideally you can use a kernel regression here that would give you the shape of the curve as it may not be linear, however you need to lax this assumption if you run out of sample due to dimensionality. With the price elasticities your can now work out the chang in revenue through a change in prices and optimise for segment and discount percentage. Next in line would be an A/B test to confirm your results, but this may prove difficult to action across departments in my experience.

If your sample size is low, you need to go with the best sample size you can have without diluting too much by segments and work under the assumption that it will reflect similarly across all segments. 

If that doesn't suffice, you can try to use a pseudo demand proxy variable, for example website visits, assuming that the conversion rate doesn't vary too much across segments once the customer lands on your page. This will substantially increase your demand sample size, but you have to deal a lot with messy webstram data, purge it first from bot traffic and other issues such as communicating this effectively to your management.

Overall it's doable, but expect a lot to do and it might take 3+ months of medium to high complexity and will depend if you have access to those data points, liaise with multiple departments (CRM, Marketing, DenOps Data engineering etc.) The key is to clean the data well and adjust by weights, and start working with the cleanest and largest sample. Bear in mind nothing is perfect, but some data-driven result is better than none at all.  It's a beautiful project to work on though and if you accomplish it you you can pat yourself on your shoulder and ask for a pay rise 😊",1

DataAnalysis,"google pompadour method basically you concentrate really hard for up to 35-40 minutes then break 10-15 minutes and repeat your productivity goes way up. I have ADHD and work as a DBA from home. First eat good high protein breakfast very important. I like protein bars or smoothies. Second have notes - I write down the steps so I don’t get confused it really helps. Get help even if your team is very busy try to shadow them just call them and share screens to see what they are doing and take notes. good notes you’ll rely less and less on having to get help for tasks. One thing I find helpful is I don’t let myself stay stuck if I tried something and it’s not working. I’ll put it in the team chat ask another teammate if they know the answer and try and Google it also, if I find the answer on Google, I will usually always check with my team to make sure they’re still doing it like that because sometimes it’s different. Eventually, you’ll get to where you can work on your own and you won’t be overwhelmed with excel it’s very easy to kind of get distracted so I use different colors to filter out the information. When you find yourself getting antsy, do those crazy tasks check your email get on teams. See what your team chats doing that type of thing. Take a walk around anything to kind of refocus yourself. I also love focus or fidget toys they really do help me concentrate on my desk I have a couple of plants nice pictures and then I have a portable set up some days. I just don’t feel like sitting at my desk like this when I get move the sofa or move my bed anyway you get the idea. Hopefully these suggestions help you.",2

Aside from that, I know excel is free lol, and I think the value of knowing how to use that well is understated with all of the new dashboard and data tools out there.

As far as hiring, most places have a bachelors degree or “equivalent” included in their qualification list for candidates. Speaking to the degree specifically, I think this is due to the assumption that there is a certain skill set that comes with the degree. This is not always the case, which is why equivalent is included (experience in using data tools outside of an institution). 

Depending on the job, I wouldn’t have an issue with hiring someone self taught as opposed to someone with a degree but has a higher learning curve. I’ve seen hiring for a position without a degree most often in the healthcare analytics space.",1

DataAnalysis,"As a nurse who is trying to pivot as well, I LOVE data.

I’m trying to find a place where I really love my job and can dive into data, so I have been looking into data scientist certs.

First off, use your industry knowledge to understand the specific skills and qualities that make a top-notch data analyst. Use this info to create detailed job descriptions and target the right candidates.  
  
Next, reach out to your connections in data analytics and recruitment to start building a network of potential clients and candidates. Attend industry events, join relevant LinkedIn groups, and engage with online communities where data professionals hang out.  
  
To get off the ground, consider starting with a small, focused niche. Maybe you could target a specific type of data analyst or a particular industry where you have the most expertise. This can help you build a reputation and gradually expand your services.  
  
Lastly, market yourself in the best possible way! Your website and LinkedIn profile must highlight your background in data analysis and recruitment. Share relevant content, such as blog posts or case studies, on this topic.  
  
That is pretty much it to get started! Best of luck with your new venture!",1
DataAnalysis,"If your phone is a source of distraction - I find the Forest app really helpful.

When working with data in a space like those, is it possible to actually feel like you’re impacting that specific space?

Obviously both the software and data fields are so big and vary by company. BUT, sometimes software feels a little removed from the target audience. Obviously this isn’t true if your the single web dev for a small company but you get my point.

I just don’t want to feel too far removed from the actual space I’m providing insight for.",1

DataAnalysis,Which track did you go through?,1
DataAnalysis,"Chat gpt answer. Not sure if it is correct. Good luck.

To create a dynamic title for your column chart in Power BI that changes based on slicer selection, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Measure for the Title**:
   - Go to the Modeling tab.
   - Click on New Measure.
   - Define the measure based on your slicer selection. For example, if you have a slicer based on a column called `Category`, you can create a measure like this:
     ```DAX
     DynamicTitle = 
     VAR SelectedCategory = SELECTEDVALUE('Table'[Category], ""All Categories"")
     RETURN ""Sales by "" & SelectedCategory
     ```

2. **Add the Measure to the Chart Title**:
   - Select your column chart.
   - Go to the Format pane.
   - Under Title, toggle the Title option to On.
   - Click the fx (conditional formatting) button next to the title text box.
   - In the Title text dialog, set the format style to ""Field value"".
   - Select the measure you created (`DynamicTitle`) and click OK.

3. **Test the Dynamic Title**:
   - Interact with your slicer. The chart title should now dynamically update based on the slicer selection.

This way, the title of your column chart will reflect the current selection of your slicer, providing more context and clarity to your visualizations.",1

DataAnalysis,"This graph shouldn't happen in my opinion. If you remove non respondents and invalids, you will have a new subtotal for each age group of which you have the relative frequencies that will add up always to 100% and therefore all bars will be having the same size. So you divide the outcome, eg a frequency category by the number of valid responses within an age group. 

Don't use pure counts as a measure for segments width, use the percentages right away. You can write the sample count for each bar (n=xx), but if the sample size of each group is large it's not necessary to show that. Non-frequential stacked graphs with varied bar lengths are mostly used in special cases when the group sample sizes tells a useful story, for example, revenue progression over time with departments as stacks. Census data is usually very large and weighted, thus having counts as a measure for the segments is not advised.

I’m surprised to hear after a computer science degree you don’t like coding. I would have thought computer science is 80% coding and logic.",10

Then some Excel coding for some ad hoc analysis.

DataAnalysis,Such an important reminder!,1
DataAnalysis,Working at a non-profit for data analysis sounds really cool! Could you share a little about your experience?,2
DataAnalysis,"The amount and complexity of programming can very widely with the job, and is a good question for you to ask during the interview. At my employer, someone at your level would be expected to be comfortable with R or SAS, and python.  You wouldn't ever be expected to develop a customized analysis tool using C - that would go to the software developers and you would just do the acceptance testing.

If you have a graduate degree in DA, that is your credential. Unlike certifications, it doesn't have to be renewed. Your experience will keep you relevant, not your certs.",7
DataAnalysis,"You might find it useful to get a vendor certification, e.g. Tableau or Power BI, but I would make a real effort to become very comfortable with SQL. Strong Excel skills will always be useful as well.",13
DataAnalysis,"I have a strong coding background (albeit non traditional), 7 years coding on the job.

My current role (hired last November) was changed to a data role as I showed basic competency in Excel.

I use what I’ve learned in my role.

Today I did:

If cell contains the string abc add one, and if cell contains the string xyz add one…

I also write formulas using multiple functions, like counting unique instances in a column. Compared to my coworker, who copies the entire sheet, uses the remove duplicates option in excel and then scrolls down to count the values.

I am forever concatenating values, splitting text…

The background knowledge I have makes it a lot easier to solve things and create “automatic” solutions that are less error prone.

I want to say my coworker is brilliant, she is incredibly smart she is in her 60s - so she has her problem solving down, but when something doesn’t format the date correctly she saves it as a csv and then copies and pastes the values back. When I showed her how I do it with built-in formulas, she takes notes. 

Being able to use logic and fundamental coding knowledge is like working with power tools while my coworkers use their hands and a butter knife. I

I see it as very handy to have.",35

This also works if you are doing something that you love and know you need to let it be just good enough or have other things to work on. Sometimes I’ll get lost spending hours writing code to clean and wonder if I just had cleaned the dang thing in excel or power query if I would have been done sooner.",2
DataAnalysis,"I think learning both is a great idea. SQL would be the main go to, but Python has a lot of great options for large data sets.",15
DataAnalysis,"Really depends on your job. I've seen it all, from full on Python to only Excel. In most jobs you need though expert SQL skills, sometimes even more than that of a data scientist.",20
DataAnalysis,"No coding/logic since sql is just a way to query data from a db and then you’ll use something like Tableau or looker studio to visualize data. Now if you want to use python/r to clean,aggregate & visualize data then a lot of coding is needed. I’m at a non profit so sql is enough for me. A bigger company you may find yourself using python/r etc",16
DataAnalysis,You have to break down the task into simple parts and check the boxes as you move along. Eventually when you become more proficient at using the software it gets much easier to focus.

I would say it usually lands somewhere in the middle. Right out of the gate, you should be very comfortable with SQL. Any languages beyond that are great, but not really needed. SQL has been used at every organization I've been at.

  
I wouldn't recommend putting tons of time into a different language at this point in your career because it could be fruitless labors depending on the route you go. If you build up a tech stack too quickly, you will be pigeon holing yourself into certain roles that may not even interest you.",124

In terms of chances, your chance of getting an offer is not dependent on how many programs you apply to.

DataAnalysis,Elvanse + redbull + tobacco,3
DataAnalysis,"I totally get where you're coming from. Managing ADHD can be really tough, especially with monotonous tasks. Here are a few things that might help:

1. **Break Tasks Down:** Try dividing the work into smaller, more manageable chunks. It can make the task feel less overwhelming and give you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each part.
2. **Use Timers:** The Pomodoro Technique might work for you—work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. It helps to maintain focus and gives you regular breaks.
3. **Create a Routine:** Having a consistent daily routine can help build habits and make it easier to get started on tasks.
4. **Find Your Peak Times:** Identify when you're most alert and focused during the day and try to tackle the most challenging tasks during those periods.
5. **Minimize Distractions:** Create a workspace that minimizes interruptions and keep your environment as organized as possible.
6. **Celebrate Small Wins:** Recognize and reward yourself for completing sections of the task. It can help boost motivation and make the process more enjoyable.

Hang in there—finding what works best for you takes time, and it's okay to experiment with different strategies. You’ve got this.",2

DataAnalysis,"1) The scatterplot is messed up as there should be a y value for 0 kids.  It sounds like they deliberately didn't include values of any nature for some couples in regards to kids.  This is a data issue that should be solved first.  Their suggested solution depending on context could be OK if it is clear that the no values only happened where there was a value and it was 0 kids.  It gets dicey after that and can turn to complete crap and misrepresentation in other situations.    
2) There is going to be a positive relationship among couples with 1-5 kids using this data.  (And where are couples with more than 5 kids?)   A scatterplot is a horrible graph to make the point about whether there is a positive correlation of marriage duration to number of kids.  It would be easier to see by doing something like column charts for five year groups with mean values and popping it into Excel to do a quick correlation to slap on as text.

Idk if there’s contractual obligations your org has with insurance companies or a funder of some sort but maybe finding a way to show them how data can help them reach X goal? Showing them their performance as far as therapy goes? X amount of clients stay with us for X years. We have a X success rate with matching clients to therapists and we can tell from X data. not sure if the company logs patient start dates and reasons for ending therapy but that might perk senior leader ears.

Thank you, I will send you a message!",2

Been almost 3 weeks and honestly, if you’re the type of learner who can learn just by reading, I would say you could get her course **mainly** because you’re coming out of it with some projects already which she lightly helps with, but this course made me realize I’m the type of learner that needs someone to explain why their answer is the answer
For the longest I have been stuck on sql joins, like why is something a left join and not an inner join? She don’t really explain it well enough for me like that. Literally ChatGPT been more help then her

Will I say I regret taking her course wholeheartedly? No. I have learned some things from it and like that I have some projects (5 of sql, 2-3 tableau dashboards total you get) but outside of that, I probably would have checked Alex the analyst on YouTube, his free course. Which I do plan on completing as well. The fact that I’m basically starting over learning with someone else I guess says something

Now for the discord, in my opinion not helpful at least for me. I ask questions constantly and no one answers me. To where I have to turn to freaking AI. That shouldn’t be the case

Please, exhaust all your free options before deciding on taking her course.

I am a mutual friend of someone who works in that industry making 6 figures that said he’d like to hire me after I learn, and he claims she’s a scam and I could learn for free and he would help me yet I didn’t listen to his advice lmao

I am still not confident enough to apply to some jobs, and she insists you can apply while learning. Again I guess it’s my learning style, I wish I could read something once, watch a video once and understand but no I gotta do it multiple times. Hope this made some sort of sense lmao

But about the certs, honestly it can help a tiny bit but it’s the projects that really help you. Make sure to tailor your resume to match an analyst resume. Alex has this on his YouTube",1

DataAnalysis,How fast did you complete the google analytics certificate? Just curious to know how many hours you dedicated to it each day to complete it?,1
DataAnalysis,"Wrote a novel - sorry, hope it helps:

I did the google analytics one on coursera. Just the basic level one. Spent 4 months really practicing everything, you'll pick up good tricks that will make your better at the job later on. 

It teaches google sheets and R, but the principles can carry over to excel and python, at least as surface level as any certificate is going to be.

 Like I mention above I had ERP system experience with an engineering department (got hired for data entry, stuck it out and got a little better spot doing slightly more advanced data entry), so YMMV of course.

I know some people give it flack, but what's good about the google cert, especially the seemingly boring ""What is Data Analysis"" part that everyone moans about/skips as fast as possible, is that it spells out in a really high detail what an analyst does. Notice how every online masters program advertises by just listing the tech stack you'll learn? Yeah a manager really gives a shit about what you used to get them an excel sheet /s

People get too excited to brag about how good they are at coding/automating processes, but 9/10 jobs need better communication because despite the reddit echo chamber, almost everyone finds technology boring lol, so it's a great section to help with that career switch because you can actually sit in an interview and sound like you know what you're talking about.

Also if you do take the course, I made myself a google site for free to showcase my capstone project. Looking back it's pretty cringe, but I think a recruiter just noticed that I bothered to make one. I also put the coursera badge on linkedin, that's probably what filtered me through.",2

Are …. are you me?? Did.. did I enter a fugue state and create a different account where I posted this exact post to this exact subreddit??

Jokes aside. Fucking THIS. My role is supposed to be an entry level data analyst (nonprofit but not in healthcare). I’m excel savvy, know power BI, have R experience, and am ok with python. I took on this job a little over a year ago because I was and very much still am passionate about the mission of my organization but the work really hadn’t been cut out for me. I’ve given up on trying to explain to my very hands off director that I don’t feel capable of effectively doing my job because there’s a bajillion CRMs and i never received any handoff or clarity on expectations for my role. The conversations started going towards the realm of “if I don’t feel cut out for the job maybe it isn’t for me” (oops) so I’ve been mucking forward and trying my damn best to make it work. I’ve been more and more closely working with teams to get visibility on their data and seeing what needs to or could be done but my goodness it feels like there’s no hitting the jackpot with how effective I could be.

While I like me a good puzzle to solve and again, I really believe in the work that the organization does for the community and I work with some amazing people, it gets really demoralizing being the only person with the insight that I have and technical expertise that tends to fall on deaf ears. I frequently question whether this job is worth sticking out. I think a sane person would’ve already left but there’s a part of me that really wants to contribute positively to the organization. We a ton of data and someone needs to be masochistic enough to stick it out. It’s just so hard to prove that I’m actually doing anything when part of my job has become simply making myself known to people and warming them up to me. Much more peopling than anticipated - not that that bugs me (I can be quite extroverted) but what may not look like work sometimes is work to enable me to do my job.

Edit: clarity",1

DataAnalysis,"I'm not entirely sure about bootcamps, google doesn't mention anything about it on their website. They only say that you should have no experience and non-relevant degree so I think you are okay. It would probably be worth it to include it on your resume to show how you are interested in the field and took initiative to start learning on your own. For example, I am applying for their DA apprenticeship, I don't have a degree nor any professional experience in data analytics. I took an online course to get the basic skills earlier this year and built my resume around it to showcase my assertiveness in trying to start a career in DA. So I think you should be okay, but I'm not entirely sure since I haven't found any info about it and I don't want to give any false info to you.",2

DataAnalysis,"COOP is just something you can put on your resume that proves to potential employers that you have experience with what they are looking for in a candidate.

I personally got a job within a couple months after COOP and I would’ve never gotten that opportunity without COOP on my resume. I know a good amount of my classmates who also got roles because of the bootcamp, but I also can’t say that everyone in my class were able to transition to becoming an analyst. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the program as it’s a great way to upskill and create connections. The job market has been very rough recently, but I know that as long as you keep trying, you’ll be able to find a role that suits you.",1

DataMining,"**I’VE KNOCKED ON** a lot of doors over the years. I’ve been in politics for long: as a congressional intern, a field organizer, and a political staffer in the Boston mayor’s office (the above name is a pseudonym as I’m still involved in politics). Dealing with voters directly is the “ground game” of field organizing, built on contact between campaigns and voters. Candidates, staffers, or volunteers knock on doors (canvassing), give would-be supporters a call (phone banking), or send a text reminding them to donate to a campaign or get out and vote (text banking). With 2024 promising to be a busy election year in the US—a lot of big issues and high stakes—it’s worth paying attention to these smaller connections. Volunteers and paid organizers who do the groundwork are the foot soldiers most campaigns rely on to win elections. For less prominent but important offices at the local and state or provincial levels, the ground game can be the single most important factor in determining the victor. This reality is reflected in high-profile campaigns too. In 2016, senator Ted Cruz invested heavily in the Iowa caucus, engaging in old-fashioned campaigning on the ground. He was rewarded with an unlikely win over his main rivals, including Donald Trump, the eventual nominee. And even with all the institutional advantages of his position, Trump and his campaign invested heavily in the 2024 New Hampshire primary, with a focus on the ground game.

AI is already being used in innovative ways to change the ground game ahead of the many US elections happening in 2024. Existing technologies are capable of texting, writing fundraising and political emails, and generating social media posts. In fact, most of the in-office aspects of campaign work can be done by AI, which does not require rest, food, coffee, office spaces, or mental health breaks. This means relentless, non-stop campaigning is a new possibility. There is a lot of rightful consternation about the potentially volatile introduction of generative artificial intelligence into politics. Fake audio clips, images, and videos are already making their way to political airwaves and may have dangerous real-world impacts. But the use of generative AI may very well also have the counterintuitive impact of making politics much more old fashioned. I would argue that, thanks to AI, professional politics will become increasingly human as back-office tasks become automated.",1

I say this because as you look back to the time, you’re in the hospital, and think about the questions the hospital staff asked you. The questions are too simple.    If there’s to be a cure for t1d, I would think there should be more questions asked while in the hospital.",1
DataMining,Did this work better?,1
DataMining,I want to know more. My daughter was diagnosed I think Covid has a link to the increase,1
DataMining,"I added your two code snippets and additionally introduced a mode for considering the two conditions (subreddit(s), keyword(s)) separate or joint (hierarchy: subreddit>keyword). This should make it easy to fiddle around with the code later.  
Depending on the results and amount of posts I will adjust the scope to be more narrow.

It looks like its running quite long again, but I will wait until I get an error.",1
DataMining,"All good.

If you still run out of memory (too many keywords or too popular), as you read, you can write into another file.

Instead of appending to a list, write a new line to a file.

Just figure what you need from the json. If you only need a couple keys, extract those and delete the rest. That will also make it smaller. 

There are techniques to handle all this and it can be processed on a regular laptop.",1
DataMining,"That makes sense. I was planning on extracting by keyword (or basically dropping everything which doesn't contain a certain keyword) after parsing the dataset into a list.   
This makes much more sense to me. Sorry for all the hassle and thanks for the help.",2
DataMining,"You’re extracting all of it and loading it onto RAM. It’s too big.

You need a subset. You need to filter it like I said. Before your all_posts.append(), filter them somehow.

Could be a subreddit, a time window, or a keyword. 

For example, to get posts from this sub,

    subreddits = ['datamining']
    if ‘subreddit’ in obj and obj[‘subreddit’] in subreddits:
        all_posts.append(obj)

if you want a keyword, then you could search for it, 

    keywords = ['dataset']
    if ‘selftext’ in obj:
        for keyword in keywords:
            if keyword in obj[‘selftext’]:
                all_posts.append(obj)
                break

The points above, the first 4 talk about this. Creating your subset basically.

You don’t need the full extracted data to plan your experiment.

You need a subset to figure out how the data is laid out and what data there is. From there, you can rerun to export another subset if needed.

Then continue with your experiment.",1
DataMining,"I tried the code you provided. I rewrote it but it seems like my system runs out of memory. I think I have to consider going back to the .csv or looking for another dataset.

You can see that it has a `subreddit` key and a `created_utc`. You mentioned that you're looking to search for a topic during a time. The first thing to try might be filtering by a subreddit (or a couple). Then you can parse, if needed, the `created_utc`, to filter by time.

You can see there's also a `selftext` key. You can use this to get the post's text.",1
DataMining,"I think I'm totally lost. I was trying to convert the compressed (.zst) file into a file I'm familiar with and that I can read. I'm guessing your way to be more effective.  
I'm planning to use Python as well.

My first steps would be the same. Check the format and stuff.

Your initial answer might be the best. Look for an already existing dataset with more simplicity. I still have plenty of time for my thesis, but its better to figure out if my dataset is actually working as proof.

The large reddit dataset offers more in-depth information as I could try to narrow it down by using other NLP methods. I'm still in-between my research question, but for now I'd like to study the polarity in messages about job concerns with the recent deployment of generative AI technologies. 

Again - hella lost. My major (thus the subject of my thesis) only includes minor NLP methodology in the bachelor but I did a Data Science minor as well. I'd like to put what I've learned to the test but it seems like the modelling isn't even the hard part (yet).",1
DataMining,"Of course.

Personally, I don’t not extract it. I would extract a few lines to see how it looks and work based on that.

The data blows up considerably in size. Not sure how you’re thinking of working with it. 

I usually work with python and what I’d do is start a notebook, read maybe 100 lines to see how they look. It’s an ndjson file inside. So read a line, call json.loads(), append to a list while the length is less than 100.

Then explore those.

You have comments and posts. Comments have a key to the post.

Comments might also have a key to another comment. This can be useful if you need the hierarchy (in case you need the structure).

> I always dealt with smaller datasets at uni.

Totally get it. And this is just 1 month… 

If you want my advice,

- read a few records
- figure out how to find what you want
- figure out your initial experiment - I see you still had questions. If you need to revisit the top ones, revisit them now.
- Now, extract your subset. This will make things easier since it’s smaller.
- Now that you have found those, figure out if you need to augment it. If it’s comments, do you need the post? If it’s posts, do you need the comments?
- now that you have that, run your experiment",1
DataMining,Thanks again for the dataset. It took me quite some time figure out how to get everything working. I'm currently using the python script to convert it into a csv. Not sure if this is going to be great a idea or not. I always dealt with smaller datasets at uni. I'm a bit confused on how I decide the fields.,1
DataMining,"Very interesting, thank you.",1
DataMining,"This is January’s dump, https://academictorrents.com/details/ac88546145ca3227e2b90e51ab477c4527dd8b90

Once you have code working with this, you can extend the date range.

There’s 2.6 _ish_ TB’s of _compressed_ data total. January is about 50GBs",1
DataMining,"True. I'm looking to add the polarity and the topic itself to the dataset as well to have it as a feature to visualize or perform more modelling on. 

Vectorizing words or creating a bag of words model would be interesting as well to find key terms. 

But I'm afraid to write too much code that is dependant on certain threshold which have to be set manually. I mean I could also try automate that with an optimization algorithm, optimizing for satistical significance. 

Got many ideas and will have lots of fun. You talked about reddit... Is there an API or method to easily access large amounts of reddit posts?",0
DataMining,"Sure, I get it.

You want to focus on this, but Twitter is not making it easy. Can it be bypassed?, yes. Can you pay for access?, yes. Will it take time?, yes.

If that’s not your project (creating the dataset), you’re picking something that already is complicated (your project), and adding an extra complexity layer (gathering your data).

If you find an older dataset, you can find a topic that happened there.

Once you have that code working, if you have time, _then_ focus on changing your dataset to the one you want with the topic you want.

The code should remain the same. It’s just the data that’s changing.",3
DataMining,"I mean my idea was to look how sentiment polarity develops over time and for a specfic topic. I'd need a more specfic dataset there, ideally relatively up to date as of the day of processing.

I want to play around in general. Maybe look into bots and misinformation. I want to tinker around until I find something interesting with enough evidence to back up any claims I would make about the data. This will mean a lot of trial and error I suppose.",1

DataMining,"Hey, not sure if it will help you, but I will try to give you how I went about my first job.

During my 2nd year of my CS undergrad, I realised I have interest in Data Science. The field is pretty broad, and I knew that I needed to try many things before finding my thing. So, by the final year, I had done a lot of Python, R, Data Viz, Basics of ML, vanilla Recommendation System projects, a little bit of NLP, basics of distributed computing using Hadoop. Along the way I also wrote on my blog irrespective of my writing skills.

Then came the job part. I didn't want to be a SDE. In job roles related to data science there were: Analyst, Statistician, Data Scientist, Data Engg, Research Scientist. There is a lot of ambiguity and day-to-day responsibilities of each of these roles. I interned at a startup as a Data Engineer. I didn't enjoy it much.  I wanted to explore each of these roles before sticking to one. And I also didn't have strong research creds or pedigree to be hired as Statistician, Data Scientist and Research Scientist. Most of the companies used to reject my resume for these roles. Fortunately, I joined a mid-level company as an Analyst and my manager gave me ML projects seeing my skills and interest. (communication with my manager about my interests was the key here). Unfortunately, analyst's profile wasn't something I was into. After one year, I switched to consulting. That also didn't work. Post that, I landed my first Data Science role. 2 out of 4 interviews were about the things I had explored in my undergrad and one of my blog posts.

In hindsight, I think the following things helped me:

- Having a blog and regularly writing on it. I always put it on my resume. I always write write-ups about my projects on it and link them on my resume.

- Writing has helped me organise my thoughts properly. It improved my verbal comm skills too.

- Kept practising the skills and learning new stuff. Put it on resume and always promote this stuff during the question: ""tell me about yourself"", ""what has been your experience till now"", ""what have you worked on till now"", and other such variations.

- Since you will be writing this technical posts, you can also promote them on social media like LinkedIn. A lot of recruiters go through your post history and judge whether you are suitable for the role.

- Of course, if you are maintaining all this then you will also know your stuff and thus will be able to clear your interviews.",4

You mentioned you want to use who is in the photo for some analysis. Are they famous ppl or her friends? For famous ppl, you could train a classifier on images of them to ID them in your pics. Options for if they are her friends are much more limited because of no training data (this is called zero-shot learning, solving this problem takes us closer to creating general AI), but one possibly is to use a Saimese network. For a Siamese network to work, you'd need at least one photo of everyone who appears in the photos.  


Once you figure out the classification part, one cool analysis you could do is called a social network analysis. It creates nodes and connections between them based on who appears in the photos together. One nifty tidbit about that is apparently we used facebook's data to implement this analysis to track terrorist groups.   


I can't really think of anything else besides just boring stats eg. average hue, saturation, value or RBGs, or a little more interesting - unsupervised learning like clustering the photos using something like K-means.

Files with the extension .a are typically static library files in Unix-like operating systems (such as Linux), but in the context of your APK game files, these are likely encrypted or encoded files. The developers have likely used a proprietary scheme to protect their assets, such as images or sounds, which is why they are not readily openable like the regular .png or .mp3 files.

To open these .a files, you would need to know the specific method used to encode or encrypt them. In general, this information is not publicly shared to prevent unauthorized modification or copying of the game assets.

If you're the developer or have legitimate reasons to access these files, you should contact the developers or check the game's development documentation for the correct method to decrypt or decode these files. Keep in mind that attempting to crack the encryption or encoding without permission could be considered illegal under digital copyright laws such as the DMCA in the United States.

On one hand, Gmail could return only those emails that it is certain are not spam, and they may determine that only 10 emails are definitely not spam, and they got 9 correct. So precision would be 9/10=90%, but in their quest to be certain, they missed 11 other emails (low recall).

On the other hand, if Gmail decides to be very thorough and to make sure that you get all relevant emails (high sensitivity/recall), then they could just allow all emails past as non spam. This returns 20 good emails and 10 billion spam emails 20/20=100% recall, but super low precision.

As you ask your model to be more sensitive you almost always lose specificity: you can ask for all the things or only the things, but not both. There is a balance that needs to be found that works with your application. Gmail probably errs on the side of a little bit of spam is better than missing a non spam email.

A less challenging problem however would be detecting people who have grown uncomfortable with their company, and perhaps
could be turned into a whistle blower. To use a negative but similar comparison, this would be like grooming people to become more extreme in their discomfort and action against a company. 

Keep in mind though, there’s a lot
of government and corporate interest in catching and stopping whistle blowers. If/when your technique works for this detection, it could do a lot
more harm than good! But then again, it’s extremely naive to think big companies aren’t already monitoring their employees for this type of behaviour… with much deeper data claws than you’ll ever have, because they can see everything done on their work computers.

DataMining,"Oh wow. Things just got a lot more complicated for me didn’t they?

Thanks for the reply. What an interesting read. 

My take away is that whether or not to choose the partitioned dataset or the aggregate dataset should be somewhat informed by common sense? Ie is the attribute that I’m using to partition the dataset a reasonable one that you’d expect to have an impact on the predicted attribute or is it somewhat arbitrary?

Did I get that right?",3

DataMining,That would be my guess.   However I think it’s a mistake for career starters to ignore the legacy technology.  Learn as much as you can from legacy systems. For example there is such a huge body of SAS code running businesses today such that a consultant can have an entire career migrating systems to modern technology.,2
DataMining,I do not. Python and R have not been in most companies for long.,1
DataMining,"Just to clarify, you'd rank those from most to least active as python, R, SAS?",1
DataMining,Ok I’ll go with that definition.  Perhaps Oracle DM is legacy (I don’t know enough about it) but certainly not SAS and R.  SAS is actively being developed and supported.  No doubt R and Python are showing incredible growth and taking market share from established players but they haven’t made SAS irrelevant by any stretch.,2
DataMining,"I'm kind of confused, what is your definition of legacy? I would think legacy is something where either the language itself the code is written in is no longer actively developed or all code that uses a particular language is only maintained.",11
DataMining,"Legacy doesn't mean not in use.   SAS is still used by almost all of the fortune 500 and a search for SAS job opportunities will return  thousands.  A legacy is a gift from the past, so to speak.  So c/c++, java, vi, Emacs, Unix,  etc are all the legacies on whose shoulders we stand and which are still very much alive. 

I would definitely call R a legacy and S a legacy to R.  Should you learn and consider using R?  Absolutely.",-1

DataMining,"Hi,

Without coding knowledge, it will be difficult for you to follow the answer that I am going to give you. But I've been thinking about your question for a while. I think it can be done, and it is relatively simple with a little of Python.

Anyway, I wanted to leave this answer in case it can help others, it could serve as an example of a method to collect data by **combining the API responses with Web Scraping**.

First of all, what you need is to generate a list of the games that are currently on the platform. This can be done by querying the Twitch API. Check Out ""[Get TopGames](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference#get-top-games)"" endpoint. Response will give you the list of top games, sorted by nº of viewers (but this number is not provided in response).

This is the response example:

        {
          ""data"": [
            {
              ""id"": ""493057"",
              ""name"": ""PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS"",
              ""box_art_url"": ""https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/ttv-boxart/PLAYERUNKNOWN%27S%20BATTLEGROUNDS-{width}x{height}.jpg""
            },
            ...
          ],
          ""pagination"":{""cursor"":""eyJiIjpudWxsLCJhIjp7Ik9mZnNldCI6MjB9fQ==""}
        }

Once you have the data, saved in a JSON or similar format, you can use it to get the information you need with **unorthodox** methods. Read the following lines.

This is how the Game category URL looks like:

    https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/PLAYERUNKNOWN'S%20BATTLEGROUNDS

You can make a python request to scrape data (followers and viewers):

        import requests
        from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
        
        inside a for loop, def or similar:
            # Load game name value from key Name in dict from JSON file
            game_name = data[""name""]
            
            # If Game Name contains white spaces, replace it for ""%20""
            game = game_name.replace("" "", ""%20"") 
        
            # Now generate the URL you will Scrape
            url = f""https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/{game}""
        
            # Make the request of the HTML Content
            requests_session = requests.Session()  
            page = requests_session.get(url)
        
            # Parse HTML content in ""page"" variable, with BS4 Library   
            soup = BeautifulSoup(page.content, 'html.parser')
        
            # Find Html tags to select exactly the data you need to collect...
            bla bla bla bla
            ...

I think that the dynamics to get data that is not available through the API is quite understood with the example we have done. I'm not going to develop it completely, but I have given you an idea of ​​where you can start looking for the information.

Let me remind you that Web Scraping is an undesirable technique for platforms and for any website. If you do it subtly, no one will notice. But if you make thousands of queries or several hundred, in a short time, you may end up with the banned IP.

DataMining,"Contrary to the popular belief, pdfa are structured. Any file format is structured in a way, because computers need to know how to parse and interpret it.

Usually, programatically you can extract the information you need if you know how to walk the internal structure from the root to the specific element you need.

Another thing to keep in mind regarding pdfs is that all pdfs are generated by some program, and the same program creating more pdf files will use the same rules to create the internal structure, so there would be some consistency between these pdfs.

A big part of the scientific papers are created with Latex, so if you figure out how Latex creates the structure where the author is stored, you could extract it from most scientific papers.

If you do need restaurant-level predictions, then perhaps Conditional Random Fields (CRF) might be worth looking into.",1
DataMining,"Hi, thanks for your response.  I work for a company which delivers orders to restaurants. When sales peak we will give them an extra delivery per week to spread the volume out across the week but they might only need this extra delivery for certain months of the year.

With the option to take this delivery out when sales drop to ‘normal’ levels.",2
DataMining,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""predicting when order sizes increase an extra delivery will be required"", so first, I recommend refining your question a bit.

I work in a web (marketing) team in a university and was asked about checking for broken links in PDFs. I had to tweak the [pdfx library](https://pypi.org/project/pdfx/) to get some relevant output and I wasn't too confident with the data I got.

The process I'd want:

1. Give the program a list of PDFs
2. It extracts all the URLs in the document
3. It checks the URLs (actual clickable links and text. Don't list the text and link versions of the same one separately. This was an issue with my attempt.)

    - Are they valid?
    - Any errors?
    - What emails are included?
    - Any phone numbers?
    - If there's links to PDFs download them and analyse them in the same way.

 4. The process ends with a spreadsheet listing the broken links and all emails in each PDF.

Some of these documents are on our intranet so the scan would have to be done from a computer in the network.

DataMining,"With your devices, you produce data such as search queries, website visits, social media posts you liked, and your location (e.g., which businesses you have visited), which represent your preferences. 

In aggregate with everyone's data, we can predict your preferences even where you have not indicated them. To give a very simple example, if you have searched for Nike shoes, it may indicate that you like basketball more than someone who has not searched for Nike shoes. 

You should understand that your data is not living in a vacuum. It is used to predict other people's preferences. For instance, if you bought premium toothpaste and steel-cut oats, then someone bought premium toothpaste could be targeted for an ad about steel-cut oats.

The more data a company has, the more they can fill in the gaps. This helps them to place the right ad at the right time to the right user. So even you, the careful shopper who comparisons shops, is just one of millions (billions?) who makes up part of the whole system. 

To learn more, you could start by reading about [collaborative filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering).",7
DataMining,"The thing is that it’s extremely cheap for companies to buy targeted ads when compared to more traditional methods like TV commercials, magazines, newspaper, etc. additionally, even if the vast majority of people are like you and never click on the ad, the fact that it’s targeted still results in a higher action rate than traditional results. If you see an ad on tv, you might be interested but you still have to go online and search for it or go to the store. You have many chances to think twice and not give into the impulse. If you click on an ad, however, it directly links to the web store and there’s much much less to stop that same impulse. So although you’ve never clicked on an ad, it still has a higher impact rate than more generic advertisements and ultimately leads to a better return on investment for those companies. That number only increases when you consider that the company serviced you virtually and not in a physical store which also (generally speaking) is more profitable for companies. 

Regardless of it you ever click that ad though, for many people if you go to research a type of product you might start with the one you saw a lot of advertising for. Then if you do buy something, targeted ads can say if there’s an ongoing sale to try and grab repeat customers attention. It’s much more direct than other advertisements and facilitates the whole process much quicker.",3

Thanks a lot for sharing that platform for data automation, I was not aware of it.",1
DataMining,"These limits are per call; A call for likes returns 20 likes.

So you're actually getting 1500 likes/15 min, or 6k likes per hour. 


From my research on 3rd party companies, they tend to charge exorbitant sums (thing a few dollars per profile) for often flawed (missing fields, repeated profiles) data;

We looked over a dozen or so solutions in my company and nothing worked.

Personally I like https://stevesie.com/ data platform for automation - I'm fairly sure you can set up multiple access points there.


Personally, I'd set up one access point per team member (+ family members, friends etc, or just make fake profiles if you feel like a pirate today), which could bump you up to 30-60k likes/hour",1
DataMining,"Indeed the user timeline API  has  quite high rate limits: 900 per 15 min. However, for the likes timeline this is limited to 75 per 15 min. And the Premium API does not increase this rates.",2
DataMining,API has high rate limits. You can collect several thousand timelines a year edit:a day,2
DataMining,"Yeah, samesiez.",1
DataMining,"No, you'd have to the search feature in the hex editor to look for the magic byte for common image types.",1
DataMining,Would any of this turn the data into images?,1
DataMining,"Open the dat files with a hex editor. Or, use the strings Unix utility.",1
DataMining,"hey, just so you know this subreddit is for [this kind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining) of data mining",1
DataMining,No problem. Let me know if you have more questions.,1
DataMining,"1. This is a huge question. I'm not sure if there are specific interests that could predict if you'll pick up data analytics easily. Have you done any reading about data analytics yet? If so, do you find it interesting? Personally, I find that if I'm going to try to learn a new skill it's 100% necessary for me to have a strong interest in the topic in order to succeed. If i'm not interested in something, it's *really* hard for me to put in the necessary effort to succeed.
2. Probably, but you can probably supplement the degree with experience if you can find someone willing to give you a chance. You may have to take a lower-than-average paying job to get the initial experience. Depending on your current comp, this may be more/less than you make now. After that I doubt anyone would care about your degree.
3. I hate web dev with a passion, but I love working with data. I think this depends largely on whether you dislike programming in general or if you like programming but dislike web dev. Programming isn't for everyone and it's not necessarily a bad thing if you don't like it. There are plenty of analyst jobs out there that don't rely on programming. However, having a solid foundation of SQL (and Python) will expand your options significantly. Have you ever done any programming that wasn't related to web dev? If so, did you enjoy it?
4. Python is amazing. It's like duct tape, it might not always be the best tool for the job but it can do most jobs pretty well. However, most data analyst jobs will use *way* more SQL than they do Python. Lots of analyst jobs rely more on dashboarding than coding, for these you'd want to check out Tableau or PowerPI. There are also plenty of jobs you can do with just Excel. Lots of directions you can go here, and it will just depend on your level of interest.

If you've never worked with data before, I'd start by learning some Excel (pivot tables, vlookups, etc). Data can be pretty abstract, and Excel provides a visual way to understand core concepts. This will ensure you have a solid foundation when you start learning SQL, Python, R, and the various dashboarding tools.",1
DataMining,"Well, message pack is a text data format like json.

https://msgpack.org

So there are standardized ways to parse it with various languages. But I don't know too much about it. And I assume it might be encrypted because of the .enc extension behind it. How that encryption was done I don't really know, there are a million ways to do it. I guess you will have to take a look at the start of the file or again find context clues.",1
DataMining,".enc isn't a standardized file type. It probably stands for ""encrypted"" or ""encoded"", but nobody can tell you how to open it from that clue alone, it depends on context, on what program created it or is supposed to read it.

If you have no context and it's smaller than 1 MB, try opening it with a text editor to check if it contains text or has some clues as to the file type at the beginning of the file. If it is bigger than 1 MB you may have to use an editor that can deal with big files, like notepad++.

If the file contains nothing but gibberish, it may be binary data or some encoded format and you may have to use a hex editor to see if there is some clue in the header or somewhere.

Good luck!",1
DataMining,"Hi, I've had a look at the site and can't seem to find an option to ""attend"" i.e. view the presentations. I'm currently studying an MSc in Comp. Sci with Data Analytics, and the current module is on data mining.

Is it possible to watch the presentations live? Is there a charge? 

Thanks.",1
DataMining,"ok, thank you",1
DataMining,Rapidminer is an easy tool to pick up and use. I suggest looking at some introduction videos on YouTube to get an idea of the data mining process and relevant real world examples in it's application.,3
DataMining,Thank you kind man,1
DataMining,"Data engineer/data analyst is probably the formal title that would encompass the skill set you're looking for. However, anyone dealing with data mining and/or web scraping is likely going to possess a skill set that can handle the first stage of your data pipeline; the sanitization and entity extraction. 

I do a fair amount of web scraping and data wrangling myself and I've got to say that I've never really heard of anyone using PHP for large-scale projects. Maybe some initial web scraping to get raw data, but when it comes to processing and extraction I see solutions almost exclusively built using Python. In some cases, C++, solutions are used when there's gigantic data sets but usually that just gets wrapped in a Cython module.",1
DataMining,"just a little bit of context I'm a front end developer, and I want to grab some data,and connect it to my front end application that i'm currently doing",1
DataMining,"Not python, but try BootCaT",1
DataMining,Hi. Thank you. I think I have found the solution I need on Github. I'd like to put ten servers on this full time for the next month.,1
DataMining,Thank you,1
DataMining,"I don't know of any off the shelf application, there are only some crawler on github but it seems none of them is doing what you want.

What's your goal? Maybe some sites like https://socialblade.com/tiktok/ can help you out?
Do you want to crawl all profiles by your own? With 800 million monthly active users and 2-3 billion downloads you'll need a pretty fast connection.",1
DataMining,wget,2
DataMining,"take a look in deviant art for  
valorant xps  
or  
valorant xnalara",2
DataMining,"Thank you, everybody, for the great replies.  You have been very helpful.",1
DataMining,"For identification of places and names the problem is best defined by named entity recognition. 

You're looking for a data analyst or data engineer role for the extraction, deduping parsing normalization etc. 

If the input set of data needs to be refreshed regularly you want the data engineer to build you a data pipeline.

I think it's unlikely to find that skillset mixed with PHP. If you were willing to go with python you might have a better chance of finding one person to do it all, although it's still not particularly likely.",1
DataMining,SOmeone that can do both would be amazing but you should do a two step process.  Find someone that has a data background to make sure it makes sense.  As well as engage them on how it would be used from an app perspective.  You can then hire a developer to implement it.,1
DataMining,You need a data scientist/analyst for the data (or a plain old statistician) and a software engineer for the app.,4
DataMining,"you can get them by county as u/caseythelegend points out. also, many choropleth visualizations can handle county level data (see for example choroplethr on github for an R package that handles it)

if you really want by zip code it's going to be a little more challenging because there's a many to many relationship between zip and county. 

googling for ""county fip to zip"" will get you to that crosswalk. then, you can use something like the NYT's covid dataset (available on github and updated daily) for the cases by fips code.",1
DataMining,"I know you can look by county

DataMining,"As far as I can find the definition of CV is to infer something from an image. If you use knn for text recognition to identify a letter. Why would that not be computer vision?

[open-cv](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCV) also contains all these algorithms.

Here is a good write up to support my [claim.](https://naadispeaks.wordpress.com/2018/08/12/deep-learning-vs-traditional-computer-vision/)

DataMining,"Computer vision is Neural Networks, no? Why would traditional ML be used there?",1
DataMining,"Apart from Neural Networks it always seems to be some spin from like the 5 basic algorithms in every AI subfield. Kmeans, knn, decision trees, naive bayes, EM. Used differently. Two of those popped up in a computer vision task I recently had to do.",2
DataMining,This reinforces my idea that ML is a subset of DM.,1
DataMining,This book [https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319285290](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319285290) has many code snippets + practical approach,1

DataMining,"I see. In that case I would recommend an introductory course to machine learning (and data mining). I don’t know immediately which course would be the best, but I’d look at online courses of good universities.",2
DataMining,"Thank you. I wanted to have an overview on these algorithms, that way I would know which one to use in what scenario. Would the MIT course suffice in this case?",0
DataMining,"Source: I’m a researcher in machine learning and data mining.

There are a **ton** of algorithms and variations on those algorithms available for a variety of tasks. I think the better question to ask is: what is my goal or task that I want to solve?

If you have a specific task you want to solve in mind (e.g., clustering, classification, outlier detection...), I would suggest looking up resources related to that task.

If you want to start learning more about the topic in general, I’d recommend looking into online courses (e.g., MIT opencourses on data mining).",2

DataMining,"I don't see anywhere in Youtube's API that they provide per-viewer breakdowns. Everything looks like aggregates and averages to me. The ""watch time"" API endpoint appears to be similar to the ""views"" endpoint except it makes an estimation as to whether viewers actually engaged with the content.  
  
It's difficult for me to test, however, as I don't run a Youtube channel with a ton of viewers.  
  
I have a bit of experience scraping Youtube for other projects, if you want to shoot me a PM of what you'd like to use this data *for*, we could possibly brainstorm some alternative ways of going about that.",1
DataMining,"You need to think creatively about how to solve this kind of problems. As a beginner you could get away with a basic linear regression to answer this question.

You can try the following:

Using the time series data of infections per country you could fit a linear regression with time (number of days since the beginning) as the predictor and log of infections (the original trend is multiplicative but the log should be linear) as the response and then extract the slope coefficients for each country. You can then match these slopes to the data of GDP per capita and fit another linear regression with GDP as your predictor and the slope as the response. You can then work out whether GDP is influencing the infection rate and by looking at the coefficient you can work out by how much.

You can take a similar approach to the second problem too.",1
DataMining,"You need to look at derivatives. Does the economic level affect the acceleration of the spread of the virus, does temperature affect the acceleration of the virus? Both are based on rate of change or slope.
So my first exploration would be, is there a correlation, probably weak to the first, close to zero on the second, just a guess. From there you can begin building models but remember many of your key dependant variables are derived from data you have. Think about the problem logically, look at what data you have, and consider what is truly relevant to the question your trying to answer. You'll get it, you just have to accept you can logic your way through.",1

DataMining,"The short answer is no, there's not a good way to extract underlying data from a image plot of the data.

The long answer is maybe...but the research time and effort just to turn that maybe into yes or no is likely more than most companies would spend.

If the problem domain is well understood and the resulting plots don't vary in dimension and fidelity too much, it may be possible, if you can get enough of these labeled by humans with the data you want...we're talking thousands, at least, of labelled reports like this one.  Not with the labels on the page, but labels in the form you'd like to see.  And if a human couldn't do it then you're out of luck.



Seems like it's be a lot easier just to get the source data.

DataMining,What languages will you be working with?,1
DataMining,"One thing you could do is convert the names and the emails to ordinal values, e.g. my@mail.com -> 0, your@email.com -> 1, her@email.com -> 2 etc

This way the likelihood for people with same e-mails or same names to be closer together in your multidimensional space is quite higher.

Then one way to find similar people is to calculate the cosine similarity between every entity in your data.",1
DataMining,And reward people for creating more data? No thank you,1
DataMining,"I'm going to go out on a limb here and suggest you're getting down voted for spending money on a pc for data mining.

My advice, use legit whatever you have lying around or a raspberry pi if you have one.

Otherwise, use some cloud service like aws, GCP, azure for scalability.

I'd probably suggest a proxy service for rotating IPs for the inevitable banning.

Happy to answer any questions or feel free to explain further what I may have missed or incorrectly assumed",6
DataMining,"Converting the file is how I would have loaded it. Double check with your professor but it should be fine.

Types refer to the data the numbers represent. For example, if the data is the results of a simple survey on favorite color the information for color would be changed to numbers such as 1 for blue, 2 for red, etc. Color is nominal since it is a name. Numbers like age or salary are numeric data.",1
DataMining,"I know this is not a quick fix, but I'd recommend looking into working with python or R for data manipulation. A library like pandas will help speed things up for you. DM me if you haven't received the help you need.",1

Start by a simple PCA with a few data to see if your factors match the diseases of those symptoms.

DataMining,"As a counterpoint to some of these:  
  
For (2), if your friend flips a coin 50 times, and it's 50 heads, you *always* call heads on the 51st flip, because your friend isn't using a fair coin. If you know that your process is truly random, this works, but if you get unusually consistent results from a process that you believe is supposed to be random, it's worth investigating either your process or your data.  
  
For (3), regression to the mean is a thing. Significance tests are the foundation of quantitative analysis, and an expectation that a set of observed values will coalesce around a population mean is a core tenet of statistics. The only time this ends up being a fallacy is when you have a mistaken belief about what the population mean is. Most times, it's reasonable to assume that an extreme observed value could be spurious, without additional data to confirm.  
  
(6) isn't a 'fallacy', it's a source of measurement error.",2
DataMining,OLTP and OLAP? Online analytical processing,1

DataMining,"I wrote it, does that count? It's not that user-friendly, the only docs are the ones you see in the github repo, and you'd be the only user other than me.",1
DataMining,"I'm not sure what you mean -- what metadata are you interested in capturing from the Analytics homepage that isn't available through downloads? Also, Analytics already provides an API (https://developers.google.com/youtube/analytics/), so I'm not sure what confidential data you are interested in obtaining that Analytics won't give you.",1
DataMining,"No, no. That part I understand. And yes, I'm fully aware that we can download *some* of the data from YouTube Analytics. However, I noticed that there's metadata showing on the page that someone who understands website language (like Java, Python, or HTML) could extract. If I could easily attempt doing the other suggestion above, I would do it. Apparently, I don't understand any of these languages.  


All that aside, do you really think that there's absolutely no software that can extract data quicker and is currently active in this era for YouTube Analytics? Because from what I understand, YouTube seems to be very confidential with almost everything regarding analytics which means you could be right.",1
DataMining,"YouTube Analytics already provides a download function -- I don't think there's a software that's going to get that data to you any faster. As the other commenter noted, you *might* be able to speed things up with automated calls using a programming library such as Python or R, but generally that level of customization isn't going to come in a pre-assembled software package.",1
DataMining,Not even Java. Is it possible to hire someone instead to create the program? And what would be the going rate for such a project? Thanks in advance.,1
DataMining,"Yes, you're right. We have some people doing the data extraction but it takes up 90% of their time but we need the analysis results fast.",1
DataMining,"So are you just looking to extract the data, or utilize that data after extraction in order to better understand something about yours or someone else's channel?",1
DataMining,"YouTube Analytics. If you have a big youtube channel, you will see hundreds to thousands of data on your analytics and it takes a large amount of time to compile and/or extract that data.",1
DataMining,"If you are not expert in Python, no R, you may be know Java then?  If you know Java, you may try DataMelt, (which is a collection of Java libraries for data analysis and data mining)",1
DataMining,"What is it that you are looking to analyze, exactly? Your goals for what you want to know will sometimes inform your software choice.",1
DataMining,I don't actually know how to use R or Python. Not really an expert in those languages.,1
DataMining,"I assume you are interested in downloading data in R or Python and do the data mining there. YouTube has an API so that there are packages to make the download easy for you, e.g. ""tuber"" in R (https://github.com/soodoku/tuber). Just install the package in R, specify your API credentials, and you should be able to load the data into your R Session.",1
DataMining,"I'm not an ethicist. That being said: contacting the mothers does seem out of line. 

I often think of people who cheat as possible disease vectors and so I think letting the wives know is probably alright. But it really depends on your intention.  I'm a Buddhist, so for me, right thoughts are important. Is she doing this to be vindictive or helpful?  Is she selfish or giving?  And she can claim noble reasoning but it's possible she's acting entirely out of pain and rage.  

Slightly off topic, but I'm gay and married men have often tried to hook up with me.  It happens so often I just have a rote response: ""I'm not helping you break your vows"". But telling the wives is something I've never considered doing because of the devestation it could cause.  Married men often have children.  Of course, these men's actions will often hurt those children in the end but then it's on them, not me.  I can totally see her side of this but it's not the path I'd choose.",4
DataMining,"Ok. So it then it would become more of a philasophical debate. It's not wrong at any point to do what she did (to include randomly contacting a stranger) but is it morally the right thing to do? I mean she's gotta be destroying lives with these actions.

But then again, who's to say that the lives weren't already going to be desteoyed and she just made it happen a little earlier. It's a very interesying situation, and I do plan on following it as she goes along.

I personally think she crosses the line with contacting the mother. I don't believe parents should be involved with their children's love affairs.  Granted I don't agree with her tracking them down in the first place, but can see why people would agree with her.",1
DataMining,"If I remember my ethics stuff from my first year correctly, Data Mining becomes illegal when you break the law to do it or use data to break the law.  So using data you don't legally have access to, or using data you have access to to commit a crime.  In the latter case, the data mining isn't illegal, just the actions resulting from it.  

This doesn't seem to cross either line.",1
DataMining,"Which is why I came to ask. This feels to me like a photgrapher following someone home. 

Good to know though. I always assumed that social media = no privacy, just nice to see it confirmed.",0
DataMining,"If you post a thing publicly, then it is accessible publicly and you have no reasonable expectation for that thing to remain private. The reasonable expectation of privacy is why it's legal to take a photo of a crowd on city streets, but illegal to follow one of those people home and point a camera at their window (but legal for them to post their own photo of themselves at home).

Her use isn't even data-mining. She's not scraping Tinder and using a script to find all profiles of married men who are looking for a discreet side-friend. She's using the software exactly as intended.",2
DataMining,"I doubt it's illegal. It is likely to be a violation of Tinder's TOS, though IANAL.",1
DataMining,"So, because she is using all publicly available resources, it's all legal? 

What would need to happen for it to be illegal?

This is all fascinating to me. I am genuinely curious how it all works.",1
DataMining,"> ‘Whenever I see a profile that says ‘married’ or ‘looking for something discreet’, I immediately swipe right to see if I can out the guy [she first asks the woman if they're in an open relationship before doing so]. 

> 'I used to do data mining as a job so I’m good at finding people on social media. It took about an hour to find his wife, but I was determined.'

It sounds like she's literally just using Google, Facebook, and TinEye.",3
DataMining,"No. I just saw the story, and it got me wondering when does data mining become illegal.

I know people do it ALL the time with things like twitch, but never really saw anything about when it's used as a personal attack.",1
DataMining,did you get caught,4
DataMining,"Oh interesting, thank you! I’ll def look into that.",1
DataMining,"You're right about NCapture and groups; a group admin has to specifically allow NCapture to access the group's data in order for it to work, regardless if the group is open or closed. (See the manual here:  http://help-ncapture.qsrinternational.com/desktop/topics/capture_from_facebook.htm#What_can_I_capture_ )

If the group is open, you should be able to use FacePager, which is an open source graphical interface to Facebook's API: 
 https://github.com/strohne/Facepager . 

If the group is closed, there's no way to get that data and it would be quite unethical anyhow.",1
DataMining,"Yes, you can probably do this with Google spreadsheets and a custom script. The best thing using it is that you have zero worries about infrastructure.",1
DataMining,stanford has a data mining course where you learn cool stuff,1
DataMining,"**Data mining**

Data mining  is the process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems. Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal to extract information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transform the information into a comprehensible structure for further use. Data mining is the analysis step of the ""knowledge discovery in databases"" process, or KDD. Aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating. The difference between data analysis and data mining is that data analysis is used to test models and hypotheses on the dataset, e.g., analyzing the effectiveness of a marketing campaign, regardless of the amount of data; in contrast, data mining uses machine-learning and statistical models to uncover clandestine or hidden patterns in a large volume of data.The term ""data mining"" is in fact a misnomer, because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction (mining) of data itself.

1. One bot: Single thread + single curl w/ loop aka 100% linear, one by one request
2. One bot but multi: Single thread + curl running in multi mode
   1. Worked for a while but started to realize several bottlenecks.  Early version (default in production) of cURL would restrict requests if an active request was still connecting
   2. Upgraded to later version of cURL and was able to bypass 1st bottle neck, but then realized a request may have multiple actions i.e. (visit page 1/generate cookie, visit page 2 based on XYZ cookie) and it becomes a pain to maintain in a single thread
3. Multi bot: Single thread controller that manages multiple thread w/ single curl (no loop)
   1. This has proven best so far.  Controller initiates bots, manages memory / health.  Each bot (thread) runs a sequence of requests 
   2. From a VPC perspective: One server is the controller; fleet of servers on standby awaiting requests.  Each server can run 30-50k bots concurrently.",1

You may want to consider web scraping solutions.

If you've never done any web scraping before, I'll give you a piece of advice:   make it a priority to throttle your app.   It's just so easy for an app to hammer a web-server with a flurry of requests.  If left unchecked this can harm performance of the server for many users, so responsible admins will take action.   It could be that your IP address gets blocked, it could be that your account gets locked, it might even be something more drastic.

So just commit yourself to throttling your app if you do any web scraping.",2
DataMining,"Thanks for the link, very interesting. My whole PhD has been focused on the study of identity-based string similarity metric.

For example, letz say your model somehow involves incomes and happiness level prediction. 30k a year vs 31k a year doesn't really contribute much to your analysis of data because 1k doesn't make too much differences happiness level of a person, and that level of granularity might even negatively affect your model, ie.  producing a model that says people who make 31k a year are happier than ppl who make 30k a year.  So this would be a good example to discretize your data perhaps into income brackets that could make your model more general.

DataMining,"My personal rule of thumb is consider if continuously valued data gives me more important information or not.

So this would be a good example to discretize your data perhaps into income brackets that could make your model more general. 

 On the other hand if you are dealing with let's say image processing, the value difference actually means a whole new color or shade that impacts the detail or realism of a predicted image,  then discretizing them into big bins might cause you to lose information on your data.  It's very application dependant. I'm not sure if this answered your question.

Technically, you could convert it into a continuous variable by taking the birth date into account to arrive at a decimal value (such as 25.634 years old).

Let's get the similarity of record 1 and 2. Gender is M in record 1 and Gender is F in record 2. 

Assuming I need to have a subset of w for every other attribute let create the following subsets

for Attr(Major): w = {science} and \~w{undeclared, arts}

for Attr(Status):  w={applied} and \~w{pending, on hold}

for Attr(Resident): w={Y} and \~w = {N}

&#x200B;

Based on equation (7) for Attr (Major) we get (2/3 + 1/2) - 1.0 = .16

for Attr(Status) we get (1/3 + 0) = .3 (I will not substract 1.0 since the value is between 0 and 1

for Attr(Resident) we get (2/3 + 1/2) - 1 = .16

Using equation (8) I get (.16 + .3 + .16) / 3 = .207

&#x200B;

Thus the similarity of the categorical data ONLY is .207. I could perform a euclidean square distance on the numerical data then add these two results together. Perhaps multiply either the numerical value or the categorical value by a weight.

DataMining,"Here’re [5 Data Mining Techniques](http://www.prowebscraper.com/blog/the-best-data-mining-techniques/) that you can leverage for your respective needs.

**1. Anomaly Detection**

Anomaly, as the word suggests, stands for an exception or aberration. In  the context of data mining, Anomaly Detection, also known as outlier  detection, is basically all about discovering the rare items or items  that don’t fit. In other words, when one detects data that deviates from  the trend, it is called [Anomaly Detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection). It could be items, events or observations that buck the trend.

&#x200B;

**2. Association Rule Learning**

[Association rule learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning)  is a rule-based machine learning method which enables you to identify  different kinds of relations between variables in large databases.

&#x200B;

**3. Cluster Analysis**

[Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis)  is basically an unsupervised machine learning approach. Cluster analysis  is a statistical method which is employed to group similar objects into  respective categories.

&#x200B;

**4. Statistical Classification**

This is a prominent data mining technique. However, it is based on supervised machine learning approach.

[Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification)  is a data mining function that assigns an object to a target classes or  categories, based on training set of data containing observations whose  category or class membership is known.

&#x200B;

**5. Regression Analysis**

[Regression analysis](https://www.surveygizmo.com/resources/blog/regression-analysis/) is a statistical method which enables you to analyze the relationship between two or more variables of interest.",2

DataMining,"Not in the same industry, but similar situation.  Most often, there are APIs or data portals where companies (organizations) can login and request information about their products (in this sense, their data).  If they can get to this data free or not depends on the organization providing the data.  Some do, some don't and there is no logic behind why....  I know one data provider that give you this information, and even demand that you retrieve it yourself in order to report back to them about the health of your business...  and the same company...  they have a division that charges you $50,000 a year to get your data (and it is such a small part of the overall business for the parent company)…  it blows my mind.

DataMining,"It's very likely they provide a service to the ports or they have a contract with customs that requires collection of that data. Whether or not they can sell that meta data depends on agreements in place. For example, my company provides a conduit between healthcare providers and the federal and state governments to facilitate Medicare/Medicaid billing. This gives us access to millions of clinical assessments that we are able to mine and use to provide analytics to providers and payors.",2
DataMining,"Okay thanks a lot for your answer.

I don't understand 100%. Once they have the invoice number they can get the the price, this I understand. But who can someone possibly guess this?

I am in China. I tried connecting with the customs , but they are not willing to share anything with me so far. Also the agents I contacted so far all seem a bit scared as they realize that I need the Chinese customs data. 

So this leads me to the question: Do customs or shipping companies have a legal obligation to keep their data secret?",2
DataMining,"Thanks a lot for the quick and highly interesting answer!

In my specific case, the client got the data less than 2 weeks after custom clearance was finished. They got the exact price, which is was stunned me. All they knew was the harbour though which I was importing the goods, they didn't even know the importing agent I used. 

Meaning, they must either have a good friend in the customs who sells them the data or there is something is don't see at the moment.

2) You call https://www.reddit.com/api/v1/access_token to get a token

3) You perform a signed call with the previous token to https://oauth.reddit.com/api/info?id=CONCATENATED_IDs and receive the data for the listed posts

After that you can either be satisfied with that data or you can scrape what is inside the posts by following the same logic.

You can also use some tools like Scrappy or Puppeteer (my default choice) to do that kind of job. You can run it on a headless machine and create a logic to wait for ajax data and follow links.

DataMining,"Im no expert on regression analysis so anyone reading feel free to correct me. You've got an interesting idea but its not how I would tackle the problem. What does your data look like? What variables have you for each employee? How many employees do you have data for?

I would probably try 2 different methods to see the differences. You could separate employees into 3 bins like you have suggested, but 3 is an arbitrary number and you should probably assess how effective 4 or 5 bins could be in the long term.

The other method is just to leave the response variable in a continuous form (I'm assuming you have the proportion of days an employee is late as part of your data) to run the analysis.

I would not however (and correct me if I have misunderstood) take only the frequently late employees to train your model. You should use a random subset of the entire dataset to train your model (say 25% of total employees depending on size of dataset), then use the remaining 75% to test, which I think is fairly standard in regression analysis.

As stated there,

>A major strength of the conference review process is the consensus-building among reviewers through a discussion phase. In contrast, associate editors typically make executive decisions, taking the reviews into account, in the case of traditional journals.

I understand that Conference Papers have a quick turnaround and may overwhelm the reviewers.

I understand that an editor also may be overwhelmed and do bad decisions.

What I don't understand is the lack of information in the rejection and no response to (at least) those who appeal.",1

DataMining,"“This can devolve into a philosophical debate pretty quickly”. Good, that is what is intended.


“Who determines what is fair? ” Normally at a conference, this is the task of three to four reviewers. Giving this power to a single person is dangerous. 
For example: That single person might desk reject half of the submissions because of a hidden agenda. Perhaps:

* To reduce her workload (of managing reviewers)

* To increase the pool of papers from female authors (laudable, but not the right mechanism)

* To increase the pool of papers from her personal friends.

* Etc.

Clearly peer review is not perfect, and cannot be perfect, but denying the right to peer review has to be worse. 
",2
DataMining,This can devolve into a philosophical debate pretty quickly. You mention fairness. Who determines what is fair? Maybe to the editor rejecting a paper like yours because it's too similar to previous work is fair. That's not to say it is fair...I think the peer review process will always be somewhat flawed because the people doing the editing and reviewing have their own personal preferences and biases. ,1

* It is considered the most robust solution
* You don’t need to install any software on your PC
* You can configure your plan and requirement
* You can get the data through API and downloadable format
* There is no restriction on the amount of data to be scraped as it runs on multiple computing environment

so, you have no worry about data extraction process, you have to just analyse your data and get fruitful insights from it.",1

The second response will contain the next set of reviews to be scraped, as well as the second data-key element. Rinse and repeat until the response no longer has a data-key element.

Here's a sudo-code example:

        //get the first page
        page = Get([base-url])

Just search the wiki how they do it or contact the authors.",1
DataMining,I think you are in the wrong subreddit. No reverse engineering here.,1
DataMining,"You want to cluster the people (rows in your data) but some of the attributes are categorical.

No Problem! Clustering only requires a distance function between two rows. The distance function you define can be a combination of euclidean distance (for the quantitative data) and an indicator function for the categorical variables. For example, if two people have the same marital status, then, on that dimension, their distance is 1. Otherwise, on that dimension, it is 0.

Let's do an example.

Age|Education|occupation|income                       
:--|:--|:--|:--                                 
35|College|Teacher|50000     
39|College|Banker|90000

the distance between these two people could be defined as

sqrt((39-35)^2 + 1 + 0 +(40000)^2 )

This is the basic idea. You should normalize the values in the columns of course. Otherwise the similarities in one column will dominate the distance. So divide the quantitative columns by the max values. Also, if some values in the categorical columns are very common, you might want to use cosine similarity instead of just the indicator function. There is a lot more to say about this topic. 

Edit: added last paragraph

DataMining,"I think for k-means the answer is no. K-means makes some assumptions about the data, namely that the clusters have equal variance and that the variances are squerical. So like if the real clusters aren't ""ball like"" k-means could find something besides the true clustering. 

Also it's a randomized algorithm so depending on the start you coul end up in different or bad positions. You only find a local minimum of the cost function not a global one. ",1

Are you constantly running into issues that you can't solve easily with excel's built-in functions? Probably time to start considering learning something like Python or R. 

Also, to clarify on the definition of data mining (from Wikipedia):

> Data mining is the computing process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems. An essential process where intelligent methods are applied to extract data patterns.

Something like splicing and sorting strings is more of a general data processing task, and wouldn't normally be considered as data mining. ",3

Some companies use easier storage methods that can easily be datamined but they usually put out patch notes with all information before the updates go live.

DataMining,"As a counter-point, If you know basic stats through linear multiple regression, at a conceptual level, it should not be that hard to take some off the shelf data from Kaggle, kernels from the same Kaggle competitions where you found the data, demonstrate that you can run the data through the code and then upload the resulting file and show you executed the code as intended and got a decent score on the leader board.

Next step would be go go through the code, segment by segment, and develop a deeper understanding of what the code is doing.

This doesn't require calculus or linear algebra.  What it requires is knowing that the code is doing a few cool text parsing routines, extracting features, running a cluster analysis on the features extracted, and then using the clusters as uber-features in the final model.  Or running a tournament of forecasting methods to get the best forecast for each department in each store over a 3 year period.

However, you need to decide what you want to do with past listings, and whether or not to consider cross listings (e.g. Malaysian/Philippine/Thai/etc. shares traded on SGX).

Next, you should decide whether you want action adjusted volume and price data, i.e. if past prices should reflect the current number of outstanding shares, or raw prices and volumes.

Once you got the list the formula `=BDH(""XYZ FIGI"",""PX_OPEN, PX_CLOSE, PX_VOLUME"", ""2004-01-01"", ""2024-12-31"")` would give you the desired data.

Data,"Households and smaller companies are so-called “captive customers”, obliged to consume electricity from their local supplier. This means that prices can vary greatly from one municipality to another: in 2022, the inhabitants of the city of Basel paid 28 cents per kWh, while the population of the municipality of Simplon in Valais paid only 11 cents. 

The electricity tariff for captive customers is a combination of the energy price, the transmission price and various taxes and charges. The bill varies from one municipality to another because of the amount of taxes levied locally, but also because of the supply strategy of the local supplier. Some companies produce a large proportion of their electricity themselves, while others buy it; some have already concluded contracts several years in advance, while others procure electricity on a short-term basis.

I got home assignments for the interviews sent and very well though. Then once I got the job I had no problem fitting in well and known to do a good job.

Data,"I recommend the DMBOK for building a data governance baseline. The DMBOK provides frameworks, not plans, so you have to take the frameworks and apply them to your particular environment. Going after certs can get you some credibility, but what turns you into an effective practitioner is understanding what it takes to manage data as a system of systems.

For getting going with some practical approaches, I recommend Non Invasive Data Governance. 

One final word of advice…be curious, flexible, and thorough. Data governance in its basic form is a consultant’s dream. Show up, tell people to classify their data and follow use/access policies, spout off about data quality, and you’re done. All of this can be done with an LLM or a $400/hour Accenture consultant and is worth nothing as an internal position. If you are curious about each governance dimension and thorough enough to develop more than a passing understanding, and are flexible enough to meet your organization where it’s at + where it needs to be in the next improvement cycle, you’ll be able to connect with the specialists in those areas within your team and you’ll be significantly more effective than playing out the textbook approaches alone. Everyone can talk about how people/process/technology come together, but if you can truly understand it within the context of your environment then you’ll be able to focus on the most important issues to govern.

Data,"So if I understand correct, you have a gigantic excel file, with inconsistent formatting.  
eg  
first 100 lines  
name; email; favorite pet; etc

then a couple thousand lines  
email; pet name; name etc

Question one  
Are the different formats at least compatible with each other? Do they use the same values, or do they track different thing?

Question two  
Did you try to sort the data already? I would propose using a tool like 'awk' to split the different sets into decentralized files, so you can work with different inputs. After that, try to get some sorting done. You don't have to do that by hand, you can either hand it to an AI and pray it doesn't fuck up, or you create one baseline template, in which you insert all the data. If you can split your dataset into multiple sets, you can look at each set, and compare the first lines with each other, to create uniformed key fields. Try to either sort your sets according to this template, or do some fun 200 char one liner, combining awk, sed and sort.  
In theory this should enable you, to use every unique key out of the different sets, and leave blanks if some sets don't use them.

I guess that's only feasible, if you have <50 different sets, but I really hope for your sake, that your company didn't have 50 separate teams, having 45 different use cases.

Data,"My 2 cents. 

The combination of excel, SQL, and any data viz ( Tableau, Power BI, Looker) is the most important combination of technical skills you will need to start and succeed. 

While technical skills are crucial the importance of those deteriorate over time so build a solid foundation on business acumen and communication. 

Learn data journey and the tools commonly used. Simple questions like how does data travel from an application to a dashboard. What is ETL/ELT? What are the top cloud providers for each stage of that journey? etc.

Learn about how a company makes revenue, that'll help you understand a business model, and then you have a good foundation of understanding KPIs because that is what you will be reporting on. 

Whenever building a dashboard test it's quality by answering two questions 
What happend? (movement in KPIs, metrics, over time) 
What contributed to the movements? ( Which attributes or combination of attributes contributed the most word the spike or fall in a KPI). 
These are the most frequent questions anybody would ask to an analyst and as long as your dashboard answers that, your credibility spikes up rapidly.

Analyst

+ Work close to the business, acting as a bridge between the engineers and the decision makers
+ Could have influence to help shape the work the engineers do
- Dependent on engineers to deliver data
- Won't develop your technical skills much, could end up just using one set of skills over and over

Engineer

+ Really build your technical skill set, a chance to work with lots of tools
+ Usually better paid than analysts
+ Your business knowledge would be really useful and help shape better technical decisions since you know what analysts want and need
- Can often become divorced from the business over time, sometimes building logic without understanding why
- Lots of pressure sometimes to deliver and fix issues

Data Scientist

+ Work on leading-edge tech and potentially interesting projects that put you on the forefront of competitive innovation
+ Potentially work on a wide variety of challenges
+ Often highest paid position
- Dependent on good data, could be frustrating if the data you're working with sucks
- Sometimes get vague requirements without really connecting what you're doing with business outcomes
- Can get stuck in perpetual loops of proof of concepts without ever seeing material impact of your work, if your company is struggling to actually understand how ML models can provide competitive advantage.",1
Data,"In reality, the day to day responsibilities of each will depend a lot on the company. Some analysts do nothing but churn out Power BI dashboards, while others might build pipelines in tools like SAS or even using Python. Below, I'll give very general descriptions:

As a data engineer, your job will be to build the pipelines that take in raw data from a source and transform it into a clean dataset ready for use. Depending on the company, that could also mean developing all the processes that go around the pipeline as well to ensure it is reliable and productionised, such as the DevOps processes. Writing the logic is the easy part: turning it into something 500 people can rely on every day is the real challenge of an engineer!

As an analyst, your job will be to use the data provided by the engineers to provide insights about what has been happening and what is currently happening, and maybe do some relatively simple extrapolation on where things are headed. You could be doing this through building transformations and logic to further refine the data the engineers provided and enrich it, though not to the same scale as engineers do. It's more like fine-tuning the data rather than building industrial-scale machines like the engineers. You may also be using visual tools like Tableau or Power BI to produce reports and dashboards.

As a data scientist, you will be consuming data from both the engineers and possibly external sources too, preparing it, and then building machine learning models to work on the data and produce an outcome of some sort. It could be to model and predict what will happen in the future, but really it could be anything. As well as building the models in Python using notebooks, you may also be responsible for the MLOps side: setting up monitoring on the model to watch for drift and retrain when needed, managing multiple versions of a model and being able to switch and deploy them seamlessly without disrupting users.",1

1) OP claims high average price variability by neighborhood which I think most people would expect but the bar chart shows a surprising amount of similarity.
2) OP claims an obvious downward trend on a graph that appears mostly flat and primarily shows a change in volatility
3) OP talks about price clusters on a chart with 5, seemingly, arbitrary dots and inadequate labels or explanations.

I assume this post is meant as an add for whatever AI service they mentioned but unless I’m just grossly misreading everything, it tells two different stories neither of which I trust at this point. It will probably motivate me to pull the dataset and do my own analysis for comparison.",1

If you mean physical forms, no, at least I don't. Most of the data I collect comes from tables (multiple records) but some come from forms (a single record per dialog). It depends on the use case.

The way that works in the platform I work with most:
- data is collected on the client side via table or form 
- it is sent to the app server via https in JSON format
- server-side validation
- app server deserializes the JSON data to Java objects
- app server writes that data to the database

The end user, a data analyst, would only need to work with opening the catalog, looking for columns and data, connecting to the final/service/gold layer and start doing visualizations.

I suggested a data lake only for simplicity, you don't need to define any schema, your code would be a simple ""get, pack, dump"", you also could use formats like parquet or delta to store data and get around with schema evolution, time lapse, partition and other benefits. Be careful with file naming and architecture because it can get messy with processing and all that ""raw, trusted, service"" kind of things.

Data,"Data science interviews can vary widely depending on the company and the specific role.

Employers may ask about your background, past projects, technical skills, and how you approach problem-solving.",1

Data,"Thanks, I really appreciate your advices and also the support, it means a lot since this morning I was wondering if all the content would be too much for me. I’ll definitely come back when I pass the exam to thank you properly.",1
Data,"It’s hard to recommend a strategy, what you’re looking for is something tailored to your preferred learning method. If what you’re doing works for you, keep doing it! 

For concepts, evaluate how your current or past employers handle the various topics. If you don’t know, ask around and bounce what you’re reading against what you’re seeing in practice. Your mileage may vary based on your employer, but I’m hoping it’s one that encourages learning l. 

For the rest, I do think the practice test is huge to understand how questions and concepts show up on the test. The first exam questions seemed to be much more straightforward than the specialist exams, so if you enjoy reading the DMBOK then I think you’re really headed in the right direction. I don’t think paid study programs are worth it, but I have the advantages of being a native American English speaker, a solid reader, and a good test taker.

If you’re enjoying the content, then read through each chapter and ear mark sentences that sound like a stodgy old professor would ask on his prized test. When you’re through the chapters, buy the exam+practice test on the first day of the month. Take the practice exam as if it’s the real thing and see how you do. I think you’ll be surprised at what you know. Once you get through, if you still feel like you need to study more, take the practice test again and try to figure out where you were wrong, then go find the answer in the book and read up on the related sections.

Data,"Yea, exactly as you said I have too many to try to do manually.",1
Data,"That helps. The other skills I mentioned were dependent on your interest. Technical or practical competencies may be more of a gateway or enabler compared to a CDMP cert depending on the situation. 

Let’s take your interest in data quality as an example. The DBMOK chapters on data quality, integrations, data governance, MDM/RDM, and data warehousing/BI are good places to start, along with Thomas Redman’s book “Data Driven”. Since you have SQL and R skills already, you’re in a good spot to jump into the more formal theory. If you didn’t have those skills then I would have recommended a technical boot camp/study plan before getting into the reading I mentioned. In practice data quality can be more data engineering than just data quality work. 

I do think the CDMP Associate/Practitioner would give you more credibility while moving into the data quality space. 

Data analysis is an amorphous bucket. This is just my opinion so take it for what it’s worth: data analysis has nothing to do with technical skill and everything to do with critical thinking and a death grip on fundamentals. If you’re going this route, become a practical expert in a marketable domain. I can get 100 qualified analysts in a day. 1 in 50 can understand a problem, ask questions, and explain their thinking logically. 1 in 200 can understand how and why analytical methods meet reality and how to account for it. People in the “1/200” category don’t need to read Weapons of Math Destruction, The Flaw Of Averages, How to Lie With Statistics, and other related content because they are humble enough to ask an almost annoying amount of questions, are wise enough to acknowledge the limits and existence of reality, and are disciplined enough to use the right analytical tool for the right problem. 

So TL;DR being a “data analyst” is an ambiguous bucket unless you specialize and are really good in a defined space.",1

Data,"Python is the language you code in. To develop and execute a program, you have two categories of options:

- Notebooks: These allow you to intermix cells of text and code and see the output immediately. You can use JupyterLab on your computer or Google Colab (https://colab.google/), which runs in the cloud and doesn't require any installation. Notebooks are great for learning, sharing, research, documentation, and demos because they provide immediate feedback and are easy to use.  
- Scripts: These are traditional programs that you write and execute. You write your code in a code editor like VS Code or PyCharm and then run the script using the Python interpreter you download from python.org. Both VS Code and PyCharm are powerful editors that support extensive features for development and debugging.

For your needs, starting with notebooks might be easier, especially with Google Colab, as it requires no setup and provides an interactive environment where you can see the results of your code immediately. However, given that you're working with large .csv files and performing backend automation, using scripts could be more appropriate in the long run. Scripts offer more control and are better suited for automating tasks on your local machine.

Both approaches have their merits, so you might want to experiment with both to see which one you prefer and which suits your workflow best. Good luck!",1

Data,"Great! Thanks! So I did some hw after my original post and it backed up most of what you're saying. You sound like someone with experience in this kinda thing. What I haven't been able to figure out (yet) about python is this...you can download python from [python.org](http://python.org) and that comes with a basic inbuilt code editor....or you could get something like pycharm or vs code. OR you could get Jupyter which is an IDE + a kinda notebook where code and notes seem to be able to live side-by-side...something that's useful for learning/sharing/research/documentation/demos....any notes you may have on how a rookie can pick between different kinds of IDE/code editors? VS code seems to be a powerful editor that's almost like an IDE in itself too.  
Thanks!",1
Data,"Using Python would be an excellent solution for your needs. Although there might be a learning curve initially, ChatGPT will help make the process smoother. Python is free and highly versatile. You can automate the ingestion of multiple .csv files, manipulate the data as needed, and use various libraries to perform your calculations and analyses. Some key libraries to consider are pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, and matplotlib or seaborn for visualization.

Additionally, the coding skills you develop will be beneficial for future projects, providing a strong foundation for more complex data analysis tasks. Python's widespread use in the data science community means you'll find plenty of resources and support as you learn.",1

Regardless, I feel for personal growth CDMP is amazing, and has broadened my thinking.",1
Data,"CDMP Master here. Can a CDMP cert give you a practical edge? Depends. Can it get you and interview/shot at a job that you would otherwise be overlooked for? Absolutely. In the case of #2, I think Associate is a reasonable target for most roles that you’d transfer into. 

Which direction you want to go in “data management” is a more relevant question. Are you looking to be a data engineer, analyst, scientist, statistician, security engineer, quality analyst/engineer, MDM architect, data architect, etc.? I ask because the DAMA cert and subsequent specialist exams are relevant to roles that cover several, if not all, dimensions of data management and are likely more valuable for senior leads/architect/management level roles. The point is, there may be other skills that could help you get where you want to go other than a CDMP cert. 

If you’re a data person and want to get your feet wet before committing, I typically recommend finding the DAMA “wheel” and reading up on related TDAN articles and resources referenced in them rather than jumping into the DMBOK directly. It’ll give you a sense of the context and content before committing. If you can’t get enough of what you’re reading and you want to learn more and do the stuff they’re talking about then it’a probably worth your time. Studying is a commitment and I’d hate to see you spend the effort unnecessarily.",2

Data,".csv files are collectively about 200MB.

My understanding of PowerBI is that it's an app like excel, but on steroids when it comes to analyzing data and making charts. Haven't been able to understand what SMSS is yet, and fair to say that Jon Snow know more about anything than I do about coding.

  
Where I want to do the calculations is part of what I'm trying to determine with my original question.  
Here's the gist of what I want to do...I intend to do multiple calculations and visualizations on each of the fields in my data. I also intend to add these new calculation columns/charts to my raw data for later review...a SIMPLE example of the kind of analysis would be calculating the 50-pt moving average, 100 point, 150 point, etc (although actual calculations could involve more complex formulae). Then I'd like to calculate out every instance where the 50-point moving average crosses the 100-point MA (I think a simple if-then formula in excel would be able to do it, but I'm not using excel). Then plot all of these MAs AND the crossover event markers on a single chart. Then calculate the most that the MA moves after one crossover event until the next one (let's call that variable ""RNG""). Then I'd like to calculate the average of RNG and also plot a distribution of the RNG values i.e. how often each RNG values occur in the whole data set.

Would you still recommend PowerBI?

Data,"CDMP Master here. I have a brief recommendation below, but before you start, make sure that you have a good reason before investing the time and energy to pass this exam. If you have little to no experience in data and/or data governance then this will be an uphill climb to pass the exam. If it’s not tied to a specific goal, such as moving into a data governance, data quality, or other data-related role then I don’t think it’s worth your time yet. Just my 2 cents, without knowing anything about your situation. 

The DMBOK-2 is super dry and hard to get through it you just sit down and try to power through. If you have little to no DG knowledge, I recommend skimming the chapter headers to get a sense of the content, then read up on TDAN articles in the areas that you know nothing about before going into the textbook. Those 2 sources align well, and TDAN articles tend to be more digestible. Also consider reading Non-Invasive Data Governance early in your journey (use the library to get a copy). Once you have a basic handle on the topic, then go read the related DMBOK chapters. Plan to do this for around 6 months if you’re working on it consistently. 

When you’re ready to commit, purchase the exam with the practice test. If memory serves you get access for a calendar month, so buy it on the first day of a new month. I found that the first exam tends to cover data quality, data warehousing and BI, security, data governance, privacy, integrations, and document retention, but that could very well be due to the bank of questions I drew (I’ve only run through the exams once). 

Take the practice test the first time as if it’s the real one and see how good you do, if you’ve been in data for a while you may surprise yourself with how much you already know. Then take it again, and estimate which sections it’s talking about, and go find the answer in the text book whether you know it or not. What you’re looking for is the pattern of how the text asks questions. Once you get an understanding of how the questions are formed, then go through the chapters with that style in mind, and close any knowledge gaps you uncover during the practice test. 

You have the month to practice once you purchase the exam. Fence off time while you’re doing this to study in whatever way works for you, but you need to commit.",1

Data,"If that's the case, then yes files of males are more likely to be rejected than females.  
The p value tells us whether there is association between the attributes or not, if the p vales is greater than 0.05 (a conventional threshhold, though you can choose other threshhold like 0.10 or 0.01), then we say that the attributes are not independent of each other.  
Chi square does not tell us about what the association is, it just tells us that there is an association. And if p value is low enough, then you can just look at percentage of male and female files rejected to see which one is higher. If you want to further solidify your report, then you can apply post hoc tests after chi square.  
though I think if you just want to know the association and don't want to publish anywhere, just looking at the percentages of both is enough when chi square square gives a significant p value.",2

How can you tell with only number of the p value ?",1
Data,"The test you are performing here is call Chi square test for testing independence of attributes, this test is performed to see if there is an association between two categorical variables. the p column in the second table refers to the p value of the chi square statistic in the value column.  
Basically the p value means probability of getting a sample as extreme as you got by chance, or probability of having a type 1 error.  
Your sample here shows that males are more likely to reject a file, and the probability of making a type 1 error here is 0.008 or 0.8%.  
In other word, if in a chi square test, if your p value is low ( conventionally lower than 0.05 ), it means there is an association between the attributes.

Data,"When I worked on my projects in uni, I focused on every possible layman question/curiosity a person can ask about the question. But the number one question I always ask and answer eventually: why should we care? Meaning, what about this data is important? And if it is important, what is it saying? And can we back it up with visualizations or math/stats?

For example, regarding the transactional data you’re talking, I’d look into sums of certain demographics, boxplots of values, distributions of values, and more basic stats stuff. This way, you can already explore the data for patterns.

And if you do happen to see patterns, try mathematically proving them with k means, apriori (as you’ve stated), PCA, and more methods! 

I love this part to data analysis tbh, it’s the most creative a data scientist/analyst can be besides data visualization, haha!

Data,"This might sound stupid, and maybe it is. But, have you explored one of the following processes?

If your management awaits “data insights”. Ask them: if they mean on data quality or if they do have specific business questions they would like to get answered from your business data. If they have questions, you can start simpler than applying any kind of clustering. Most analyses are statistical values like standard deviation. The ability to interpret them requires context from you and your management.  
  
Do clustering or other unsupervised learning techniques and visualize. [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/unsupervised\_learning.html](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/unsupervised_learning.html) Once done, see if you can find question, which arise.

Focus on getting better in statistics and math, search for algorithms in ML and learn them and where to apply them, it's more about using the right model at the right time in DS rather than coding itself

Your disingenuousness is reflected in the simple fact that you did not draft this post to “discuss the broader concept that demographic changes can shape societal norms and identities, including discussions about symbols and representation”.  If you did, that would have been the title and premise. 

Instead, this is a poorly drafted dog whistle intended to criticize immigration - specifically Muslim immigration.

You chose the path of a coward (and continue to double down on your cowardice in the comments) instead of stating your real claim/issue outright and standing behind it with whatever rationale you rely on to support this ideology.

So please, continue with your attempted obfuscation but no one is fooled, and we are both now well aware you are a coward.",1

I mean, we can continue playing coy make-believe about the true intentions behind your post.  I personally find your entire approach cowardly.  If you have an opinion, you should state it outright and stand behind it.  Trying to obfuscate the ideological underpinnings that motivate you with poorly designed smoke and mirrors is just immature and weaselly.  

Perhaps, some introspection would serve you well.  If you think your viewpoint is so unacceptable for even an anonymous public forum that you decided not to be forthright and direct AND continue to pretend throughout the comments that you’re just engaging in hypothetical thought exercises for the sake of open-minded critical review, then maybe your time would be better spent evaluating the basis and cause for your underlying beliefs (applying your advocated-for criticality to your self).

I promise you that long and thoughtful introspection will be way more productive than this charade.

Here is a pretty good (albeit cursory) summary of grounded theory QDA provided by a platform tool that, among my peers, is commonly used and recognizably reliable: [https://www.maxqda.com/blogpost/grounded-theory-analysis](https://www.maxqda.com/blogpost/grounded-theory-analysis).  

But again, you don't have to use this tool or any paid tool.  While they could speed up your analytic process, they all have moderate learning curves and probably offer way more functionality than you need. 

The alternative is to go with a DIY/ homegrown approach.  This might still take time up front (e.g., reviewing your initial dataset to define several+ themes), but then could be semi-automated and refined. 

And... ...  even the up-front time could be minimized by using interactive online AI tools.  For example, I just fed [perplexity.ai](https://perplexity.ai) a bunch of text and asked it to provide me with frequency counts of the most common words and most common phrases.  It was slower than I would have expected but did exactly as I asked -- within a few minutes I received a keyword analysis, a non-visualized word cloud, and a phrase (idea) analysis -- without having to do anything more than devise a couple prompts.  I then asked it to describe 3-4 themes based on the uploaded text data; it did this easily.  Finally I asked it to examine the text according to valence and let me know the frequency of positive, negative or neutral passages.  It didn't perform well on this particular task, but three out of four is not bad!",3
Data,"The top bullet reads like it wasn't for a company but rather your own undertakings. You should describe the types of analyses here where possible using the following structure: ""A Stakeholder needed insight on monthly user statistics to help drive business goals. Once I gathered their requirements, I developed a plan. I connected multiple streams of data using Python and SQL to join data points together. I Performed frequency analysis and aggregated data to create accurate and audible statistics. Then I created compelling visuals in Power-BI and reviewed final deliverables with Stakeholder to gain user acceptance. My process was fully documented and I reviewed any lessons learned for reference on future projects. ""

Your experience as a customer service representative is over the top and laughable the way it is written. You are also highlighting the wrong skillsets. Sure, checking people out quickly is a nice data point, but why do i care as a hiring manager? Rather, you should focus on the soft skills that typically come from a CSR role: good communication skills, ability to work in a fast paced, high demanding environment, team player who can communicate and manage both up and down, etc. Etc.

This concept should appear throughout your resume:  well organized, documented, and audible process. Good oral and written communicator.

Don't apply through indeed/linked in. If you see a job you like, go to the companies website. Find the career secrion and look up the job. To make to easier look for an JR (job requisition numbers) that you can search on the website. Applying directly is a good separator.

Lastly, people will tell you not to have a cover letter for an entry level. Do have one. In the first paragraph call attention to your skillsets (both technical and soft skills)

Second paragraph tell them why you want to work for such a company. Speak to their mission and why it is so critical you must be on their team. ""My experience doing these types of analyses will help company A build thier goal of doing awesome shit""",1
Data,"Like u/TexSolo said, understand what you’re trying to analyze first, then organize the data to do so effectively.

Guessing from the example of fictional data, in this case you are looking to track occurrences aggression/aggressive behavior, with data for : 
- period_of_day
- date
- type
- location

After organizing the data into a table with the columns stated above, I would add a row for each occurrence, with the values for that occurrence. 

With this new table, you can more easily define your X and Y axis to more meaningful graphs, so, for example, it could be a time series graph and with enough data you can try to see trends in occurrences. In this case, X is a range of dates containing the occurrences, and Y could be a count of the type of occurrences.",2

Data,"You can summarize less relatable job exp, maybe just keep it a 1 liner or just omit it. Else do expand more on the personal projects you've done. If you're able to categorise the dashboards you've done it'll be better.

Data,"Well, for one you need to figure out what you’re wanting to understand as a X vs Y situation. 

You are also building a horizontal structure. 

What does the 1 represent? If it’s a Y/N 1/0 binary situation, then it is a different matter than if you are recording discrete numbers then that would be something else. 


Honestly, I don’t think it’s a good way to record information, you should probably record each individual instance, since it is easier to determine correlation between different independent variables. 

Also, it doesn’t seem to include a large amount of data.",2
Data,"Of course! Btw, how are things going with this initiative?",1
Data,"Not sure what jobs exactly you’ve already applied to, but I’d recommend applying to anything that seems like it’d be in the general data realm - like, if you look at it and think “eh this isn’t really what I’m looking for but it’s not that far off” it might be an ok option. Job apps are a numbers game so it’s hard to say what is a good or bad option because the wider the net, the higher the chance you get something. Once you have professional experience, even if tangential, it gets easier to get the job you want.

If you’re okay to apply and wait, then no reason to settle. But if you want a job fast then imo that’s the way to go.

Example: one of my college friends also wanted to be a data analyst upon graduation but had no luck; so she ended up settling for a job as marketing analyst instead (which she described as editing excel sheets all day - not doing much). She reworded that experience a bit to emphasize the impact of her work (presented data to leadership, helped generate $Y in revenue, helped cut out the slack by X%, etc.) which helped her land a mid level BI analyst role after less then a year which paid nearly double. It’s not that she was doing anything particularly relevant to BI (or much at all, from how she described it), but she was just able to frame it in a way that showed her as someone who drives impact, which in turn shows that she understands how she can provide value to the company -> this is ultimately what employers care about.",1
Data,"I don't see a single review mentioning obtaining a job... Just people who liked the resume he made for them. But I would assume If they reached out for help, they are not a credible source to quality resumes as they had to pay to have one written for them?

On top of that, the way the reviews are written seem to me as if they were solicited. That is complete speculation, but still a strong suspicion.",5
Data,What related positions do you recommend I search for?,1
Data,"If you have specific projects that you can showcase, especially if they were for someone else, that may help. For example, the “personal power bi projects” section reads as if you did it for a company, so even if this wasn’t paid, you can call it freelance experience. (Which sounds better than a personal project because it implies you were held accountable for the result)

But also, if you’re desperate for a job, I’d recommend taking something that’s related but pays less, work there for 6mo, then apply for some DA jobs again with that experience front and center on your resume.",5

Data,"Hey, we explored this question a but more on Hacker News. Copying the answer here:

>Yes, we're going to build the make modern data tool with a low barrier to entry (so non-devs, non-data folks can use it) but that also works great for power users (a way better jupyter notebook, with modern IDE like capabilities - pair programming, copilot, extension, out-of-the-box linting, testing etc). It's almost a meta thing but I think dev-tools have been getting better and better over the last 10-20 years while data tools seem to be stuck in the past. Devs, when then see friction, go build something to solve it while this tendency is much less common in data scientists, for eg.

&#x200B;

The idea is for anyone working with data to be able to use this product - it should have a  ""low-ceiling, high floor"". Meaning, if you are a non-tech person looking to do some data analysis, you should be able to do that without needing to install something from the terminal.

If, on the other hand, you are a power user (data scientist, analyst), this tool should be able to let you do all you can with your current tools (jupyter notebooks) but better!",1

If outsourcing to the Philippines, your options are to either engage with a freelancer for contract work, or hire someone full time through an employer of record (EOR). Going with an EOR is more expensive but it means that the individual(s) working for you are receiving benefits like social security, pension payments, and potentially health insurance (amongst other benefits offered by their employer).

It comes with baked-in configurations for varying levels of access for different users and comes with some reporting capabilities. SFDC is also a very scalable solution that can grow as it is expanded across the organization. Lastly, depending on how complex your reporting needs are, you could also leverage a cloud data warehouse to store the SFDC data to make customized reports.

I think the point I was making in my first post was that 3D6 can only range from 3-18 when counting normally. though I suppose you could formulate some rules of reassignment analogous to the 0 being counted as either a 0 or a 10 to make it work but it would be a bit more complicated",1

Data,"Couple things-  


Data Science is pretty much high level communications degree. Sure you do fancy things with numbers, but if you can't tell people why it matters, then you aren't doing your job.   


From the post, seems like English could be a strong start! Mostly corporate talk and presentation skills, know how to sell yourself and also listen to what other people want, not what they say. Corporate doesn't care about your fancy graphs, they want to make money- how do your fancy graphs make them money? Maybe look for public speaking/ business classes- you gotta present what you know so non tech  people can understand   


Technical wise-  
Excel,   
SQL,  
Python,  
And a Bi tool  


This will get you pretty far. Additionally, India from what I heard is tough to find work. I would consider finding a work visa for other countries- Data Science is in hot demand right now and I am sure Italy or Canada, even US, could do with your help if you are an expert.   


For work experience, just email any nonprofit a portfolio and your skills and they will put you to work. If not, the projects, portfolio, free boot camps should be good.   


Lastly, if you want to freelance after not finishing work this could also be a good option. You might be able to charge way less and target nonprofits/ mid market companies who need analysis but can't hire.

Data,"I work at a fairly large (Fortune 100) company. It's not social media but some of this will generalize.

We differentiate between ""user data"" and ""transactional data"". User data is anything used for personalization or identifying a customer. It might have an analytics purpose but isn't necessary for us to measure P&Ls, etc. If a customer asks us to delete their data, this has to go. Transactional data is completely anonymized business records that we need to keep an accurate accounting of our sales, sign ups, etc. Transactional data does not need to be deleted because it has too much importance for accurate record keeping and because it cannot be tied back to a customer if we delete all their user data. In other words, we don't need to delete your internal user ID or the transactions associated with that ID, but we would have to delete your name, address, phone number, etc. Even if you delete your Facebook account and request to have your data deleted, they are still allowed to know SOMEONE had an account. They just can't know it was you.

There is a centralized data team at our company responsible for overseeing individual teams use of user data. Ideally, they want to be the only team storing user data so that customer requests for deleting it can be handled in a centralized fashion. If you do not move your data to be stored by them, then your team has to be able to process requests from customers to delete their data.  Again, that's specific to us, but any large company is going to have to handle requests under CCPA or GDPR (i.e. customer data deletion requests), and that will be achieved through a shared responsibility between small, individual data teams and broader data and compliance orgs.",1

Data,"Well, the question is very vague. Have you ever programmed before?
You'd need a python installation, of course. At first, probably no extra libraries, though pandas and numpy might be handy.

To make it clean, you can have multiple steps:
1 - read an input file and write to a tabular representation (CSV, JSON, parquet) (source to raw)
2 - read those files, apply the transformation, and write it out again (raw to transformed)
3 depends - either convert to excel or create a visual and store as an image

You'd create a separate script for each step and run them manually at first, carefully checking the intermediates.
If you are acquainted with jupyter lab, you could use it to develop your steps. But it also introduces another level of installation complexity if you don't know it yet.",1

This is a bit of a loaded question as PDFs can be semi-structured or they can be embedded images. And how you get the data out kind of depends on which one we're talking about.

Ola Roberto! Tudo bom?

Thanks so much again for this data and API.

I went ahead and accessed this API through PowerShell, downloaded to CSV files and uploaded them to SQL server.

I did this all live on Twitch in Spanish and uploaded the video on YouTube.  Here’s the link! https://youtu.be/fszMy-xXRgM?si=tm1aL19HwAoBf244

The first 5 minutes are describing and 04:25  Timestamp has a special message for your team to thank you for your awesome work.

Thank you so much, and wish you much success with the event as it wraps up!

Links to your pages and channel are in the video description, and so is a Google drive link with all my source code (PowerShell/SQL) and PBIX file if you should want them.

Link to my final report in Power BI (interactive): https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMzM3Y2JkM2EtZWU1OC00OWQzLWE5YTAtNDljYWFlNGQ1ZmJiIiwidCI6IjdkZjczZTQwLWRlNzktNDk1MC1iYWQzLTkwODkwNTA3ZTM5OCIsImMiOjJ9

Probably recording the English version this weekend on Twitch as well.  I’ll be adding full history for the events too.

Valeu Roberto!",2
DataSets,Thanks for this!,2
DataSets,"Check out https://kaggle.com and https://Data.gov to see what’s popular now.


Reality is that what is impactful for you may not be for others.  Can be Olympics, government, climate, finance, unemployment rates, etc.

You need to choose something that is important to YOU and that YOU are passionate about.

For example, positive datasets about Puerto Rico are what is important for me, and I focus on that (among a few other topics).

However for one of my videos I chose cheeses of the world as a topic, just to show that you can make any topic interesting to the right audience.",17
DataSets,AWS S3 would be a good choice here.,2

You can also try github. If it is a large dataset use git lfs.",2
DataSets,"Unless you have several hundred columns, excel can handle 12k rows.

In my anecdotal experience working with large sheets, I didn’t start to see serious performance issues until I had a few hundred thousand rows (150 columns).  Around a million rows was the tipping point and I eventually dumped it in an MS Access db.",5
DataSets,"That's not extremely large.

That's not even slightly medium.

Just stick them in a folder somewhere and have a naming convention.",18
DataSets,I gotta keep it private. Can't be made public.,1
DataSets,Your right I'm thinking that a good naming convention might solve the haystack issue with Google sheets but it's a serious pain. Besides that I fear accidental modification.

DataSets,in a database,5

DataSets,"If space is the issue, you should know that CSV files compress very well. You can bring down a multi-gigabyte CSV file to a few hundred megabytes (or even smaller).

(This is not to say there isn’t source data behind the source data, You didn’t tell us what this is or where you got it from.)

Whatever you do archive them. In the exact form you got them in.

You might want to convert them to one format or another.  Because it might be more convenient for you do do some processing or transformation.

I don’t understand the Google Sheets haystack issue. Been a while since I’ve used Google sheets. Are there folders? Even if not I presume you could use a naming convention. You can write a README document explaining the naming convention.

But don’t convert to GS and them discard the CSVs.

If you’re concerned about accidental deletion, make sure where ever you store them has access controls you can set.",1

DataSets,[Relevant xkcd](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tasks.png),1
DataSets,"Not sure I have anything practical to add, but what you’re trying to do is called entity resolution, which is matching together different variations of describing the same thing. Like your example with the full name Lionel Messi and just his last name Messi. Those two responses should count as the same person (Messi).

Depending on what scale your survey is, for example, is it dozens of responses or hundreds or thousands, it might be practical for you to simply go through yourself and consolidate partial names to the full name. But if you have tens of thousands of responses or more, then you might need to enlist the help of a coder or some kind of service that can assist you with doing this in an automated way using fuzzy matching and edit distances and those kinds of algorithms.

Thinking about your specific example of the sports players, there are perhaps not too many different ways the names might be written. It will probably be last name if the player is very famous, or the player’s full name. If a very famous player has a nickname, then you might get the nickname by itself, which could be tricky.

Even in Microsoft Excel or other spreadsheet programs, you can use a formula to take the last word of a cell. If a cell contains just one word, then this would grab just that word. But if the cell contains someone’s full name, such as two or three different words being first and last name or first and middle and last name, then it would grab just the last word, which would probably be the last name. This quick and dirty way of pulling out just the last word in the response might help you consolidate putting everyone’s answers as a last name. You would still have to resolve cases where two different players had the same last name. But maybe there are not too many examples of that and you can do this manually.",2

DataSets,I can definitely see using only nexus would skew more towards those titles for sure. I do wonder what TSR's numbers are for sims 4 mods. (I believe that's the largest site used for specifically the sims),1
DataSets,"It's hard to say, but my impression is that such the top 3 are:
- Skyrim
- Minecraft 
- The Sims 4

It is also necessary to define how we understand a mod. Because if we mean some huge modifications that change the whole game then certainly Skyrim belongs to the top. On the other hand, if we also count small things then The Sims is probably also in the top. Well, and it depends on how many people play a given title. Minecraft is played by millions, every day, but how many of them use mods? Is a texture pack also a modification? Difficult to describe. 

You can always look at the Nexus top and see that the top 5 are:
- Skyrim (two versions) 
- Fallout 4
- Fallout New Vegas 
- Stardew Valley 
- Cyberpunk 2077

Stardew Valley and Cyberpunk surprised me a lot. But I was also surprised that the top 3 were Todd Howard games",1

I don’t mean the same exact image , they could be two different frames but the image settings such as lighting are the same, same guitar etc. My recommendation would be to train a model with image sets from videos 1,2,3 and use video 4 for testing. Then do the same by training with images from videos 1,2,4 and apply it to label video 3 and so on. This way is a lot closer to a real life use case of your model where your classifier will label complete unseen images.

DataSets,"I don't know if you know a programming language, but if you do I would advise you to try scraping the data directly from a website. Normally the data is actually messy due to the fact that the websites should serve humans and not computers. If you can't write a scaper yourself you can probably google for scraped datasets.

Messy things in web scraping data I found:
- A lot of missing values (e.g. prices only per direct message)
- Different granularity (e.g. addresses with house number vs. only having a zip code)
- Characters indicating different units (e.g. 100K vs. 100M which means 100000 vs. 100000000)
- HTML tags and escape codes in between text (e.g. ""Luxurious &amp; big property in <b>Philadelphia</b>"")
- Multiple information in the same field (e.g. ""Kitchen, Pool, Extra bathroom"", ""Extra bathroom, Garden, Kitchen"")
- HTML tags or CSS classes for indicating a different status (e.g. strike-through price meaning old price)

There is probably more than the above and scraping a lot of data is almost guaranteed to result in dirty data. Another advantage is that this is a real world scenario since web scraping is used much for competitive or market analysis.",2

DataSets,"Hey, thank you for taking an interest in my issue.

Alright, I'll try to answer your question to the best of my capabilities. As far as I know, there are a bit less than 1k users of this database. They are mostly nurses that will update the new data for a patient or something similar. The biggest interest for this database is to run studies and to see if it is interesting to do a certain study (for example, seeing if there is a correlation between weight and sleep apnea). I do a weekly storage to keep the data up to date (that takes about 1h30) since it's in a cloud that takes a bit of time to compute. From what I know, the database is stored on a server in Paris. I don't think we have direct access to it, but we use a cloud as a middle point or something similar to generate queries using SAS and MySQL Workbench. My boss said that he wants to migrate to something that is 'closer' to the database so we don't have to export every time we want to do something and therefore gain computing time.

The dependencies are kind of all over the place and this is what some people dislike. There are, I think, no foreign keys, and to get to values, you sometimes have to do 10 left joins to get them together. The only keys available are the primary key, which is more often than not the patient\_id or table\_id.

There seem to be relations, a bit like folders with different tables that share a similar name (e.g., custom\_fields\_xxx, studies\_xxx, exam\_xxx...).

I don't know if I'm clear because it's really blurry in my head, but tell me if you need more info, I'll be happy to give it to you.",1
DataSets,"Okay, wow that is an interesting problem. How much leeway do you have to revise it? Do you know if any of the tables have been deprecated so that they exist but really aren't needed?

Let's start with who is using it and how often. Do you have thousands of users running queries daily or 2 people running monthly reports? The former is a cloud solution, the latter can be cloud, on-prem or some combination depending on your security needs. I think Azure has a connector for SAS DBs to support easy migration though I'd expect any of the cloud platforms would have that.

The biggest headache will be understanding the dependencies between tables well enough to migrate primary keys before foreign keys so that every foreign key references an existing primary key.  You did say crappy, and 120 tables without foreign keys sounds rage-inducing, not merely crappy. This is where having a data architect is important to simplify your relational models.",1

I was writing software for HFT at the time. We needed to record the incoming feeds in case we lost connection, server crash, etc. so we could avoid a time-consuming “full rewind” request. We needed all the data from the opening (actually preopening…) to build order books in memory. This requires every order event including non-trade data from open.

I just have some random dates. We had a weekly physical back up routine.Fedex-ing drives around between New York and two other points. And I still have some of those drives.

I studied the data periodically in order to tune strategies and see where we could make improvements. 

In the mid 2000s we started to notice what we called “flashing“ well before it became headline news. Orders that remain on the books so briefly that they couldn’t possibly be interpreted as valid attempts to buy or sell. The timing indicated that it was only possible that a cancellation was sent out immediately after an order was placed and could not be in reaction to market data.

DataSets,"Hey OP, 

I'm a neophyte too, and have been coding for a 1.5yrs, I'm also insecure about my code so I didn't start this one. However, I figured a good start is a good plan of approach. 
I'm sure you've learned that you can't jump in, I tried my first year coding. A little time spent on planning goes a long way, especially after writing 100+ lines. I'm not web scraping often but I think both beautiful soup and selenium packages are for doing the same thing, selenium is more of a high level web scrape library. 
You may also want to use regex, for string manipulation during searching and extracting data. 

Another thing to consider while planning is to build a ml model to take in the web page data, and locate the desired data and return it.  
Each site may structure or phrase the data differently. It may be efficient to have a model located it instead. Try to locate the desired  information scraping a couple site yourself, while testing the scraping portion of the script, and see if you're able to recognize an obvious pattern with the tags or verbage. Another model will have to be built if you want the data to be quantified, generalized, or categorized if the original being returned is not sufficient.

Finally while planning search through the Internet, to see if someone has built a model similar or designed for your objective. Try looking though sites like kaggle, Google datasets, and ollama. 
You'll want to avoid having to train the model from scratch, it's a process and half, and far more complex. Some pretrained model have weights available for download so that you just have to retrain (light training) and tune the model to fit your exact needs. Could be worth downloading a pretrained LLM then tuning it for your project. 

After all that planning sitting down and writing a script to help you soft through benefits should be easier. If you haven't already, open up an account with openai and use chatGPR to help you during the journey. Keep in mind that it's a VERY, VERY useful tool but it's going to fix every problem you encounter and wil prevent you from actually learning how to code unless you breakdown and understand why it's using certain methods to handle problems.

Hope this helps, best wishes and Godspeed.",1

It would be beneficial to both the venue and attendants. You’d be able to provide congestion maps to better understand foot traffic and timing, as well as to be able to provide insight to customer demand.

Taking it a step farther, you could use Google Maps  APIs to pull in traffic patterns around events, and make suggestions for routes taken depending on arrival time. Provide recommendations for restaurants and hotels 

Also some easy ones you can pull in. I’d look at historical ticket prices vs days out of event by venue. Very similar to how flight pricing works on Google. You can identify when the best time would be to purchase tickets.

Edit: I’m probably over thinking this now, but if you really want Venues to utilize it, building ICPs (Ideal Customer Profiles) for both the bands and venue would be freaking legendary. Bands usually cater to certain demographics right? Understanding those demographics surrounding the venue would help align their event calendars to maximize that market. From there, you could work with a third party vendor like Outreach to send targeted marketing campaigns. Smaller bands can also utilize it in reverse. Work with you to understand what venues they might have the most success at.

All of this would work for more than bands. Venues that have other stage acts/comedians. All could use the same data if it’s built from a venue perspective.",1

I do a lot of work with fiber, dwdm, and otn making two times more than what I used to make..my next move is probably going to be either network engineer for the isp or optical transport engineer",2
DataCenter,"I wouldn't do it to be honest.  At least not a lone. DCs are very complicated. you need a good amount of money and qualified people to be run a DC. Plus there is so much competitions in this area. I would really want to have some business partners that specialized in DC management. Someone that you can trust to do electrical, IT infrastructure, marketing, legal stuff..",1

DataCenter,"Hi there, not trying to intimidate you but it's a lot. I was recently hired at AWS as an EOT, which seems to be the position you're applying for.  Your interviewer is right, the position deals with the mechanical and electrical capabilities of the data center. If you don't have knowledge of either mechanical cooling or electricity and power, it might be an uphill climb.

For electrical, you should try to brush up on: how electricity flows from substations to transformers; the relationship between current, resistance, and voltage; single vs. three-phase power; what an ATS is; what a VFD is; what a UPS is; what a PDU is; and fuses, transistors, and ground-fault protection. At least, these items are what I was asked.

For mechanical (cooling), brush up on: what a dew point is; wet bulb vs. dry bulb; what an AHU is and the process of moving and cooling air; relation between humidity and relative humidity; lockout/tagout; causes for an increase an amperage to a motor; and generators.

Finally, Amazon is big on these things called Leadership Principles; they mean a lot to the culture at Amazon, so make sure you have stories (in the form of STAR questions) that relate to LPs. They can make or break your interview more than the technical experience. Good luck!",3
DataCenter,"The big issue is the actual delta T generated more than the compute capacity. I work at a >100MW data center, we have an endless supply of ~115 +/- 15f exhaust air. That's a lot of wasted energy, but what do you do with it? It's not enough to boil anything to drive a traditional turbine. You could try a Stirling engine, but the max ideal stirling efficiency is like 20%, and the power generated wouldn't offset the costs of maintaining it. You can use it to heat water or something, but then the distance comes into play. With your 120f air you might get 100f water, which wont stay 100f for very ling. And then you have to factor in the fact that anything you place in the way of your air path is just going to make your supply air fans have to work harder to drive your cooling air which is going to cause efficiency losses too. It's not an easy problem to solve",1
DataCenter,"Very true!  Great quote from your colleague .  That’s why I believe edge and modular Datacenters can be highly advantageous in the heat reuse space.  But then your colleague points out the next issue, is there enough compute capacity to provide the required heat reuse!     Thanks for your perspective",1
DataCenter,What’s the secret?,1
DataCenter,Do you remember what the subjects were for Hardware? Thank you in advance,1
DataCenter,"certs are nice, but we look at those as extras. work in the dc is generally pretty physical and very detail oriented. passing the test is great if you can do that, but the physical aspect is a whole different can of worms.

a bit of advice i can think of:
ask questions, get a second set of eyes if you're unsure, always go slow and take notes or pictures of how things are before unplugging/removing them. label cables you unplug during service so you can get them back in the right place. sometimes the people that have been there forever will be a little hard to get information from at first, but that will come in time as you can show you're ready to take it in. if there's multiple power setups in different racks keep in mind that devices that only take 120 volt input will let out the magic smoke if you plug them into a 208 volt pdu. check your inputs power inputs!

my place does hire people with no prior experience. just some basic windows/linux os and networking questions that i think are listed on the job application. as others have said a lot of otj training. this particular dc is multi tenant and everyone has a different setup

10+ years, ready for at least 10 more. it allowed me to save up enough for a house. come hang out in the dc, it's got really good air conditioning, and a sauna like areas if that's what you like.

good luck, you'll do fine!",2

Datacenter itself is relatively simple. You need AC, power and fiber connection. Last one is the most expensive and complex part, especially if you want redundant paths. 

The owner is a service Hoster and ISP, renting dedicated servers. So he build this so he can host his own stuff and rent out the place to customer. 

So starting a Datacenter needs 3 things: right place, right facility and lots of money to invest (AC, diesel generators, building etc)

Some sites are very slow and you end up looking for busy work and watching YouTube on your phone.  Others have you doing constant rack and stack, pulling cables, and auditing connections.

I only very occasionally get to do any hardware swaps or configure anything.  

The job has mostly been very routine.

------

The interview focused on my culture fit since this is a job where you are often spending long hours alongside one or two other techs. 

The job is definitely less technical than my prior work, but the financial risk a bad hire poses to the company is much higher. They definitely want to know they hired someone who will cover a shift in an emergency, who can be relied on to show up on-time, and who won't unplug anything without triple checking that all the details are correct.",3

DataCenter,"No you are not. Start doing some planning and check for location, legislation and if these can work... Jump to capital",2
DataCenter,"Highly depends on a location. Getting legal permits, certification, environmental permits, and whatnot in order to even start building it can be crazy long process, expensive or even not possible if money is not there ready to be burnt. Also look into local power availability as well as fiber connectivity in the area. It's not just ""let's build a DC here"". Also to sell heat and pull it into existing district heating or whatever heat distribution system there is you must be in relative vicinity of urban area where heat is needed. If you need to transfer it long distance (where land is cheaper) then you also might have a problem.

Good luck nevertheless, interesting topic",2
DataCenter,"> I've gone from DC tech (60k) to leading a team of techs (85k) to Engineer (still some DC work, but mostly coding/automation for various clients). I currently make 120+. What is your business? I'm looking to increase my compensation for my family and advance my career. Things feel stagnant where I am.

I work for a company that builds and helps maintain data centers. Basically, I had dozens of customers that kept asking for people to do various work. Can you install cage material? Know anyone who can install aisle frame/ containment? Can you help me figure out where I'm losing cooling? Do you know anyone that can decom my equipment in Santa Clara, transport and re-install in Phoenix? Do you know people who can set cabs and install overhead cable trays, structured ceiling, etc...

Basically over the years, I've talked to so many data center managers and critical infrastructure engineers who just wanted an easier solution than wrangling a dozen + different vendors that only do this one thing. So I and a couple former co-workers started a company to do all those things.

Long story short, data centers are cyclic between the infrastructure and IT equipment poles. Right now with the AI boom, the infrastructure side of the house is the bottleneck. The IT side is waiting for that to catch up. I'm seeing that we're now designing gigawatt DCs. 5 years ago a 20 MW DC was considered medium/ large. Hot/ Cold Aisle containment is becoming absolutely necessary. The network you build is how you keep the finger on the pulse.

TL;DR: Basically my whole job is to go to data centers, ask what their major pain point is and solve it. Then they throw money at me.",1

To the OP... of the techs I've worked with (including myself), the ones to find further opportunity were the ones who...

were kept communication professional,

eager to learn, (be self driving in that aspect from time to time)

innovative, (find ways to improve quality or speed of work. i.e. I created an application that automated configs for servers, reducing config times from hours to seconds. It also removed human error, bringing quality to 100%. I also had it generate Excel reports to document every build)

and had strong work ethic (don't take shortcuts, pay close attention when working in a production environment - small mistakes can lead to major problems that will get you immediately fired, and just don't be lazy)

We all get complacent, and there is nothing wrong with where you are at or if you want to keep that routine. Though there may be a point in the future where you want to advance your career, the opportunity may not be there right away.

The data center industry is exploding, and most of the good guys get snatched up by the big players who can afford to pay a lot. That would be my hesitation for working for a startup, you're not likely to match my FAANG pay/benefits.

I think the only reality check would be your grand plans for heat reuse. It's HARD to capture waste heat in a way that doesn't ultimately cost you money. There's a reason almost every industrial process in the world just vents it to the environment. A very intelligent engineer I used to know has a quote along the lines of ""either you don't have enough waste heat to be usable, or you're too far from anywhere to use it"" and that's very accurate for DC's. I know of one that uses it's waste heat to heat water for the town that it's in, but usually DC's are either in Virginia or the middle of nowhere which invalidates that. Not saying that you shouldn't try solving it, but if you do you'll be very wealthy because you've done what no one else could",10

FYI, There is a ZERO % chance I expected the Seller to produce a power report. We even used an intermediary for the land offers to avoid getting the price jacked up because of our Corp name.

FYI we had a power team that handle all the power challenges across the country and their contracts. I would not expect the land seller to even know what a power report is or how to ask for one.

Perhaps your Real Est. agent is dreaming of a monster deal $$$, so he might be pushing you towards a risky investment.

Any DC builder worth it salt will know the power companies and deal with them directly and usually under a Non-Disclosure.

FYI, we need farms way more than DC's.",1
DataCenter,"It really depends on your personal goals and personality. I had the cush gig as a NOC tech in a colo with good bennies. After 3 years I realized I wasn't learning anything anymore, I wasn't expanding. I solved the same problem over and over and over and over. It got to the point where I could ask two to four questions, know what the problem is, ignore the customer and just go fix it. Then I'd call back and say try it now? Works fine? Mmmmkay bye. Back to YouTube.

If that's your thing, all power to you. I'm the curious kind. I wanna know everything I don't know. I like to learn and constantly put the puzzle pieces together.

Long story short, my formal training was a Computer Information Systems degree, several certs that all expired, who cares. I started paying attention to the infrastructure side of data centers, asking questions, learning about power and cooling, etc...

There is a major shortage of qualified people who know data centers, ESPECIALLY people who can speak the IT side and the infrastructure side of the house. In 5 years I went from never having been in a data center making $40k/yr to quadrupling my salary with my own business and turning down jobs left and right.

If you truly love networking and want to focus on that, go for it. But if you can broaden out a little, and know just enough to wade into the weeds of how everything fits together, you'll find you're the 10lb gold nugget everyone wants to throw money at.

If you feel like you've capped off at what you can learn, and you're looking for growth already a month into your current job at 60k, I would say that you already know what you're going to do.",2
DataCenter,"While I agree that data center companies are probably trying to shirk costs by having OP provide the power study instead of buying it themselves, it's probably not the worst idea in the world for OP to have that power study on hand assuming it doesn't cost an arm and a leg to have done.   The value of the land to OP right now is that of farmland, which having recently been an observer to a land sale could be something like $4000-5000/acre.  However, the value of having power readily accessible to a data center is significantly higher - I don't have a number for that offhand, but it could easily double the value of the land.

I work for a large hyperscaler who is building out data centers and we have to keep every land negotiation very hush-hush until it's complete because if people catch word that it's us trying to buy land, the price of the land immediately triples because they know we have deep pockets.  And not every bit of land is valuable to us, either - as OP is highlighting, we need power and water available for us to be able to run and cool our data centers.  It's well worth OP's time and a bit of OP's money to understand the value of the land he's thinking about selling to the buyers before he just goes and sells it.",4
DataCenter,"If you still have the contact information for the developers, ask them if they can elaborate on what one is and how to go about getting one.    If they build data centers they should know what exactly that entails and who provides them.  If the utility company is who is supposed to provide it, ask if they have contacts at the utility company you can reach out to.

My work with data centers comes well after they've started designing and building everything because I work on the connections from data centers to other data centers, so I can't give you a ton of information on what power studies actually are.  But given that I've been (lightly) involved with multiple new data center builds over the past year I can say that data centers require tremendous amounts of stable power and so anyone looking to build a data center is looking for both transmission and capacity - you need power generation to be available as well as needing the ability to get it to the data centers.  This is likely why you need to get the study from the power company and the kind of information they're looking for.",2
DataCenter,"A power study or desktop study is always a burden on the seller, if they want powered land prices.",8
DataCenter,"You need real help to figure this out. Your real estate agent can't help you with this. Substations and transmission lines don't mean you have power capacity for data centers. 

You can't do this yourself. Call ASG (Appleby) or Treat or Tract (Van Royen). They're all on Linkedin. They can all do a desktop study to determine your next steps. 

But yes, you'll need to shell out some money to get to the next step. $100k or so.",4
DataCenter,Power Company.,11
DataCenter,"If you have farmland you're sitting on, there's no reason for these data center providers to call you and asking if **you've** done a power study. 

Your price to sell is your price to sell the land. They're just trying to cheapskate around getting a power study done. Basically, they don't want to incur the risk of paying for the study and then finding out there's no power. They want **you** to spend the money and take on that risk of there being no capacity to spare. I'm not certain, but potentially they can't do the study if it's not their land? That I'm not sure of.

If you intend to sell to a data center, keep in mind that most data centers have way more money than you might ever think so keep that in mind for negotiations. And then the land will effectively turn into zoning for light industrial. That includes the traffic, the trucks, the generators, then Air Handling equipment, etc etc. I see a lot of peaceful quiet farmers in the middle of nowhere selling land and not really expecting (or being lied to) that data centers are a 24/7 operation with all the light and noise associated with keeping them running.",10
DataCenter,What's a PoCo?,13
DataCenter,"A power study is completed by the local utility that owns those high-voltage transmission lines.  It serves to tell you *IF* there is any power available for you from those lines *AND* what grid upgrades you or the developer will need to pay to realize that power to your site.

The first study you'll pay for ranges from 50-90k.  This study tells you if there's power.  Assuming there is, the next study will also cost you 50k-90k to tell you what additional equipment will need to be added to the upstream distribution before you can connect.

If you're truly in farmland, the devs that are calling you are looking for AI-campuses.  They'll want 200-500MW of power allocated to your land before they see value in it.

As an aside, I just had this conversation w/ my local PoCo and they hinted to us that the grid upgrades required for a project they're working on with a different devco were in excess of $150,000,000 BEFORE the new farmland could hope to see any electrons...  Your experience may vary.",16

DataCenter,"I'm not OP, I'm not a student. Just interested in data centers and learning more about them. Thanks for the suggestion on Black Hills, I kind of had a hard time understanding it. So MS has on site generation, which usually you would use whenever the dispatch costs of that on site generation is lower than the spot rate for power...so I don't understand how MS lets the utility to access the asset - unless of course they are being paid a hefty rate by the utillity for access to that generation. 

As per above - on 1) makes sense 2) i wonder if there is a lot of load variability for a data center, and if there was that is a good explanation for a mix of fixed and floating rate.",1
DataCenter,"What kind of a student are you?   
  
Regarding your questions, my suggestion would be to look up tariffs that utilities have created specifically for data centers, and then you can see the exact answers to your questions. You could google phrases like ""microsoft data center utility tariff wyoming"" to find the custom one that Black Hills Energy created for them in Wyoming, and I assume you could find many other variations of the above in different locations.

My expectation is that all the different scenarios you're imagining probably exist, though I expect that the more common arrangement would be 1) yes, 2) majority fraction fixed & minority fraction floating, 3) usually have a contract with predetermined pricing for renewable and/or carbon removal attributes",2

DataCenter,Bingo,1
DataCenter,"Demarcation is the point where one party's responsibility ends and another party's responsibility begins.  It's usually an extremely specific point to minimize the ability for parties to point fingers at each other to determine who is at fault.

Let's start with a simple example - say that I've got two facilities across town from each other, and have contracted with a fiber provider to connect the two sites with dark fiber.  Each site will have a demarcation point where the fiber provider's responsibility begins/ends and my responsibility ends/begins, usually in the form of a patch panel on the edge of the building.  A forklift knocks down the overhead conduit inside the building to the server room?  That's my problem to fix.  The water company accidentally cuts the fiber outside of the building doing repairs?  That's the fiber provider's responsibility.

In a more complex scenario, when we set up in a colo connecting to a leased wave provider within the same building to reach a different site, you can have multiple points of demarcation.  Within our cage, all of the active devices are our responsibility *but* the colo provider will provide a patch panel to connect us with the ISP over in the MMR.  Say that our Ethernet link to the ISP has gone down.  Our responsibility ends at the front of that patch panel - if we put a hard loop up there and the port comes up within expected optical performance levels, our gear is working and we escalate to the colo provider and the ISP.  The colo provider will provide a fiber connection from our cage to the MMR where the ISPs are set up, and so that fiber is their responsibility to maintain/repair.  They're responsible from the back of our patch panel to some point in the MMR - it is often the back of the patch panel in the MMR, but it can also be the fiber patch cord that connects to the ports on the ISP's devices.  Let's say it's the patch panel - if the colo provider puts a hard loop up on the front of the patch panel and our port comes up with good optical levels, it proves out the colo's fiber as the problem and the troubleshooting then goes to the ISP.  

Active devices *can* be the demarcation point, but things get a lot messier when that's the case.  Let's say you have a media converter - the fiber is owned by the ISP, the copper is owned by you.  If the ports on the media converter itself start giving off bad packets, whose responsibility is it to replace the media converter?   Everything needs to be clearly spelled out as to who owns what.  If the ISP owns the ONT, do they also own the fiber from the edge of the building to the ONT, or is that the site owner's responsibility?  If the site owner is responsible for it, then the patch panel is the demarcation point and if the ISP can move the ONT over there and it works then the problem belongs to the site owner.",5
DataCenter,"Would possibly need to see all the column headers or what data is being asked for in the audit to really get an idea of what they are looking for.

1. So the DC pays a fixed charge to reserve capacity, so is that expressed in $/KW/month? 

2. Unit pricing, so you pay $/KWh based on usage, is that fixed by a PPA or is that just a floating rate for power pulled from the grid? 

3. So you guys buy carbon offsets rather than have a contract with a renewable energy source?",2

Sometimes there's multiple ""demarcs"" to be aware of if you're dealing with an MMR within a colocation site that has many tenants

DataCenter,"I'll be working in Pennsylvania. Like I said it's a brand new facility. I got through the first round of interviews and only stumbled on some transformer questions so I had to dust off a few textbooks from my industrial electrical days. Everything else I've worked on, which is why I jumped at the application. The recruiter said they have a training regimen and I'll need to be a self starter but that was never an issue for me. The entire reason I left water plant operations was because I was never allowed to go fix or repair anything since the jobs were delineated by the union.",1
DataCenter,Depends the country,1
DataCenter,What city or state are you going to work in?,1
DataCenter,"All data centers ask the same questions. The technical part consist of HVAC and some mechanical questions. They'll ask basic electricity and motor control questions. You'll be expected to read and draw an electrical one line of your facility. Implement the AWS principles in your personality questions. They may ask chiller questions even though no one you work with has probably seen or operated one lol. Most ppl have never ran a building so don't feel like your alone in the journey. 

The navy nuclear program is embedded in the data center work place. The questions are excessive compared to the equipment you'll actually see onsite. 

I've been an stationary engineer for 14 years and data centers are the way to go. 

It seems intense but it's not.",1
DataCenter,They're gonna be running 12 hour shifts at this center and the schedule doesn't look too bad. The start wages are already way better than anything in my immediate area so I'll be pleased with either the low end or high end of the starting wages. Just have to study this next week and prep for the panel interview.,1
DataCenter,You'll power the racks but I'll the hardware install and troubleshooting is handle by another team. Eots are responsible for getting power to the I/t load like most data centers. Now you will respond to a rack down with the dco and fall back if it's out of your scope of work. Make sure you ask about midnight oil if you want overtime. That's how you add some extra cushion to your life lol,2
DataCenter,"This is the answer I needed! I also have gotten my hands dirty with data cabling punch downs, jacks and terminations,  racking, even ran and spliced fiberoptic cables. So I have lots of well rounded experience for every part of the facility. This info is great, I really appreciate it.",1
DataCenter,It's like the hunger games at AWS. But it will position you to go anywhere. You already have the knowledge to do the job. It's operations and maintenance for a critical environment which is the(data hall). The equipment is small and simple compared to operating a high pressure boiler and chiller plant. The most overwhelming part of starting is digesting all the information they throw at you from onboarding to landing racks. Then work process and what application to use. But it will slow down. Get with the right group of eots. Be cordial with everyone. Your peers do have a chance to review you annually. The FM is judge jury and executioner. I've seen them make and break careers for petty things or get folks promoted that still couldnt use a volt meter.,2
DataCenter,I would essentially be coming in as raw brain material to be trained to their specs and this is also a brand spanking new data center built right next to a nuclear site they're getting power from directly.,1

DataCenter,"Can anyone speak to how long the onboarding process is if going through a 3rd party recruiting company? The account manager I'm working with said MS doesn't interview for DCT (T1) positions directly, instead taking the recruiting firm's recommendations. Once an informal interview was done an offer will usually take a few days to come through. The informal interview with an Engagement Manager went well and he said since MS is looking to fill positions immediately, it would be a week/week and a half to onboard and start work. 

Is this realistic or not? I feel like they basically told me I have a job, it's just waiting on MS to release the offer. Curious how long others have had to wait to get an offer when going through a 3rd party recruiting company",1

DataCenter,"I don't know that there is an official EIA/TIA or uptime designation but I can see a need for one to describe Distributed Redundant systems. This would be a data hall or building with more than two separate power systems feeding active equipment.  Newer Nvidia chassis recommend three independent power sources so the N+1 or 2N systems are not ideal.  

I wouldn't be surprised to see a Tier V designation in the future to accommodate the AI deployments. Likely the industry will have solved it and EIA/TIA/UI will document what everyone is doing.",1
DataCenter,"A slightly different perspective for you. 

I used to market, plan and build enterprise high security (Gov Sec level III) data centres starting from the late 70's until 2020'ish. Now retired. 

I have witnessed decades of DC growth and innovations. Was even part of the award winning team for the facility design of one of the greenest data centers in the world which is still listed as one of the top 2% in efficiency.

That said there were three things that were critical throughout the years.

1. Literally EVERY single installation will likely evolve over time to a point where it will not have enough Colling/Power density unless you plan big. Planning for power density levels that seem unimaginable a few years ago is a very difficult thing to get approved at the corporate capital levels. In some cases, we needed to go all the way to the Board of Directors with the risk modeling to get approvals. Customers are now demanding rack power/cooling in excess of 20KW per rack when the best design models forecasted 5 to 7 KW/per rack averages.

2. Location and connectivity: Most data centres have carrier rooms and adequate fibre access to major Telcom providers but customers are demanding almost Dark Fibre speeds for enterprise and Internet access. Managing these diverse group of carriers for customers was complicated to say the least and probably was the biggest reason for major outages and problems over the years. Data Centre Network design was critical to being successful.

3. Tier requirements for DC power security/redundancy/survivability. One of the most difficult tasks was choosing a new DC location. Getting access to redundant power grids in the MW range is not an easy task. Combine that with trying to secure Green Power makes it even harder. In one case the decision to change our build location by 50 miles across a Provincial boundry saved over $40 Million in Hydro/OPEX costs per year.  
I make this point because the biggest complaint customers had was THEIR cost/KW for quality DC Space. They want Walmart pricing for Maseratti power.


Hope this helps.",3
DataCenter,"Depends on what kind of companies you like to work FOR.

You want slower career growth but longer more stable companies, look to the Magnificent 7.  

You want more of a fast-paced, high growth environment, I'd recommend the folks who provide DC space to the Mag7 like:  DLR, Equinix, Switch, Stack, Prime, NTT, etc.

ALL of these companies need qualified folks in their facilities operations departments and RIGHT NOW is the time where you can command the highest premium for your labor.  Negotiate well and good luck!!!",1

DataCenter,"I saw in other comments here you are on rotation to different job groups, make the most of it and good contacts. I’d say if you are willing to learn and can demonstrate it well, you can do what you want really. Schneider Electric has some good free DC infrastructure courses that might be a good jumping point",7
DataCenter,"Depending on your location and situation, I’d say vote with your feet, unless you are happy where you are. Leadership like that is hard to deal with, sorry to hear it",3
DataCenter,Sounds like a management problem and not a staff problem.  Adding spying tools is a recipe for disaster - word travels fast in the DC world.,2
DataCenter,That makes sense. IMO larger tech drives larger trends in the industry. But from my perspective Facilities Operations is a great a growing role. It gives you a larger scope of everything that happens within the DC. If its growing as a company it also makes you a SME which could leader to Director roles depending on the growth and how well you adapt solutions for operations.,4
DataCenter,"Nope, as much as I had observed. some of my managers were from AWS & Meta and there's no weight difference unless you join a really small company after you have raked up some experience in the big guns. It's all about the operational exposure",1

DataCenter,I've been in that role for 5 years and it's a dead end. Nobody in my company moves up. They want us all to stay put where we are.,2
DataCenter,Microsoft as a company or specifically data centers?,2
DataCenter,"Oh wow, that is fascinating - I agree that these jobs can’t be AI’d as you said but my main concern is that the industry is new to me, and I won’t be knowledgeable enough to find a position within operations 

Being transparent, the mechanical side of things is what is most challenging to me, and I have a feeling if I do get “placed” there-I won’t be able to perform at the level and/or knowledge that is expected",1
DataCenter,"I would say Operations. Anything physically in the data center. Facility operations can branch long term to engineering, specialty teams, management, etc. Hardware work on servers/racks can lead to other teams as well, and management. IMO these are jobs that can’t be easily “AI’d” and are typically always needed and present. You can also learn a lot and be specialized to make a robust career that is business cycle proof.

Mind you, I’m quite bias, I was in facility operations for five years and moved from it to an engineering role.",11
DataCenter,"Yea, I hear you 

So it’s not a mega cap tech company, and focuses primarily on leasing space and power so a colo provider 

And the firm is pretty established and rapidly growing 

I don’t think I would transfer to another company anytime soon, but the more transferable skills the better in my opinion",3
DataCenter,"It’s a hard question to answer as each company operates differently. If your company is more of a contractor and they rely on head count to make money, it would be different from working for a mega cap tech company. Are you understanding of your companies direction? Are they established in the industry or a new player? Do you plan to use the skills acquired to transfer them to another company?",2

DataCenter,Liquid cooling is only way to go probably best with a hybrid system utilizing the integrated active temp sensor tech belimo has for instant info from the cloud and able to be efficient as possible saving massively on energy demand in the long run especially for if you wish to upgrade your hardware once chip advancement takes place do some research on future chip cooling needs in my opinion most of the current hvac companies doing data centers are way behind the ball not even mentioning direct to chip liquid cooling. Those old air only systems will create some angry new data center owners once they come to the realization they could have saved massively integrating liquid cooling in initial design especially with the automated temp monitoring ability to send the cooling directly where it’s needed just my two cents.,1

Yes, you’re paying them to do rounds and readings, PPMs but you’re also paying them to be on site just incase something goes wrong.

I’m sure there’s lots of work that can be done on a night shift - updating processes, reviewing docs etc.

If you really want to make it part of their job, just use a CMMS properly that has barcodes on the assets and scan them and update the readings. It’s actually better for everyone as you can see the last readings and check trends in voltage, current, temperature etc.

DataCenter,"Yea.  Monthly fees.  I’ve only ever seen this in US data centers.  

I get the one time fee. That makes sense.  But the recurring charges seem an odd place to milk the cow.  

I guess I can see that if you’re a multi floor facility and you have limited vertical run. But like if your gonna lay fiber between my cage and a carriers, and it’s just running in an empty 12” raceway under the hallway, like give me a break.  

If the data center is so bad at setting their prices, and needs to come up with extra charges to make ends meet, this seems like the weirdest place to go.  Charge me for every time I enter the building, or send a package there, or go to the bathroom.  At least that better correlates to a usage fee.  You need to staff for that.  Fiber under the floor takes up no resources.   But THATS where the recurring cost is?  (It seems weird)",1

So technically they have none of the benefits and probably won’t be listing the faang company as their employer on resumes. They are neither included in any communications or meetings on campus. 

A janitor telling me they work at a faang company would be met with instant sympathy because I know how much these big corps squeeze out of them.

Also, working the night shift in a DC ain't fun.  If the work is being done I would allow some slack to be honest, but if you are not so inclined, give them something interesting to do. Are there projects or initiatives you can get them involved in? Have you talked to them about the shifts and any ideas how to make their life interesting/easierf/enjoyable?

DataCenter,"You actually don't need multiple high-voltage supplies, you only need two independent high-voltage supplies, which will constitute your A supply and B supply, and then every other redundancy downstream can be built using a coupler system

Where I work, we have only one independent supply  that feeds two MV transformers; that is still a reliable 2N supply, especially if you make sure there is no single source of failure as you build the downstream redundancies",4
DataCenter,"Typically the ""2N+1"" part of a topology begins AT the data center not necessarily 'upstream' at the utility.  There are of course exceptions, but most Hyperscale colo / cloud / AI providers do NOT have discreet feeds from multiple utilities or disparate utility substations feeding their campuses.  You increasingly see multiple feeds from multiple substations but they're typically from the same PoCo, not independent PoCo's.

Most DC campuses will have multiple feeds from a local substation, say in 10MW size, that are then distributed to the buildings on the campus based on their design constraints (10 of them for a 100MW building and so forth).

There are some DC developers who are building their own substations on their property.  This can be because the local utility is requiring them to do so, ex:  My local PoCo mandates that any draw over 150MW in aggregate that the developer needs to build and operate the substation.  Your local PoCo will vary.  It could also be driven by the developers desire to have more granular control over who they buy their power from and how it gets delivered to the site.  If you own your own substation, you can get into some pretty big negotiations nationally that can severely reduce the cost per kw of delivered power.

If you have a property that has 230kV lines overhead, that *COULD* be good, but it *COULD* also be bad.  The beneficial attributes are easy to see, but there's tons of caveats that go along with tapping into those 230kV lines, bringing them to a switching yard, which then connects to your substation (you're getting used to the idea of owning your own substation right?), which then steps down in a cascade from 230 / 69 / 12.4 / 480 / 415/240 at the rack.  You're responsible for ALL of these power transformation points including the transformers, protective devices, and sitewide distribution of the power to the varying voltage levels you use for equipment onsite.

So, where I'd start is by declaring, ""how much you're going to develop on this land"" and if that answer is under 200MW of total IT load when its all said and done, I'd recommend having the PoCo provide and operate the substation.  Mind you, it's going to take them 3-5 years to build and turn on this substation, primarily because they cannot buy the equipment needed for the actual build as these are all LONG lead time items in the current market.  (I was just quoted 36 months for an 80MVA 230kV / 69kV utility grade step down transformer as an example)

If you're end load is going to be over 200MW, you'll want to own the substation(s).  Going down this path, you'll still need the PoCo to build a switching yard to tap into those 230kV lines, but if you've got friends who can get you equipment, you are likely able to design/build your own substation in 18 months.  AGAIN, this is if you have FRIENDS in the business who can prioritize your equipment orders over other companies like MSFT / NVDA / GOOG / META / APPL who are ALSO trying to buy up all of this equipment that they can.  

This market is white hot and as such, development opportunities abound.  Make sure you've got somewhere to buy the equipment before you go entering into any land deals or energy service agreements as we're now seeing a ""timeframe"" placed on these deals by the PoCo's as well.  They'll say to you, ""We've got XXX MW of power for you, but you need to be consuming it by XXX date on the calendar.  If your new dev is NOT operational and consuming at least XX% of allocation by the contracted date, we have first right to sell that capacity to someone who has the current need for it.  Obviously if that happens in the middle of your deal, you're dead in the water with 10's of millions invested by that point.

Hope this helps! ;)",26

DataCenter,"Stop spreading DC propaganda.

DC’s literally refer to their workers as smart hands.   As a data center technician your main job is to keep those servers up.  This involves changing out components.

If you work in a colo dc, for the data center itself, they have employees who do nothing but change out components for their customers, maybe sometime they work on cabling and other stuff too, but it’s mostly swapping out bad components.

If you work in a large scale data center, with say 100,000 servers, it’s 90% changing out components or bad optics.

Sure, there are some actual tasks that involve thinking and diagnosing issues, but you’re mainly there to get the servers back online, which involves changing components or disks.

A lot of the troubleshooting is done through automation.

Dont waste your time in the DC.

That’s just my opinion, as someone who has worked in several data centers.",1

Why do they hire like that? When you have specialized technicians who are being paid fairly well it's hard to ask them to go swap hard drives all day and do zero technical work.  It's also quite a bit more expensive.  If there's a huge backlog, you're going to be swapping, but otherwise it would be mostly diagnosing things in the repairs queue.  Hope this makes sense.

I've heard that typically the training is provided after hire, but in some of the job postings I've seen for smaller data centers, they prefer you to get it before hand.

Your best bet is to look up colos in your local metro area and apply. As long as you can show up on time, follow instructions, and keep your hands to yourself, you should do OK.

For DCT then A+ can get you in the door for some companies, Net+ will be very beneficial as well. I knew a guy who got hired on as DCT with just a Linux+, but they also had strong hardware knowledge.

I got hired on through a recruiter with no certs or professional experience but I had a strong portfolio of personal projects and volunteer work as well as acing the technical portion of the interview.

Some companies have even lower requirements for some positions. For example AWS has WBLP for DCO techs and don't expect you to have certs or previous professional experience, for that position you can probably just study the A+ core 1 a bit and be able to pass the technical interview.

Odds are, if you haven't already received NFPA70E electrical safety training in prior jobs, you may not have the experience to get hired in a DC for electrical roles.

No matter what you do, you have to work on your people skills. You need to make people believe that you will never drop power or cause an outage and instill them with confidence.

DataCenter,"You'll find that there aren't a lot of real ""rules"" out there for this stuff. Some things might be different from company to company, but there's a few things you can do where if you explain is reasonably enough, you can breeze through these things.

* OSHA 30 is good, and always painful to do. There is no expiration date for this, while some states or companies might impose recertification times. I've seen 5 years as a rough number. My last company said that if you have your OSHA 30, you only had to redo OSHA 10 every three years.

* NFPA 70e - Yeah there's a lot of sketchy sites out there, but there are some that are legit that I've used before, and they've been acceptable and never questioned at any place I've been (including globally recognized data center construction sites with dedicated safety teams who actually check your certifications before badging). Clicksafety is one of them and the other is 360training. Both cost money, both give you certificates afterwards. I've personally used both.

* Another that pops up is First Aid / CPR / AED training. The Red Cross is a good place to get this done. They have an online portion and an in-person instruction portion. This expires every 2 years I think. https://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/lp/cpr-first-aid-aed-certification-new-hero

* Never done the CompTIA stuff. I've been on the industrial side of things, not the network side.

* Schneider Electric's DCCA is good, but I've only really recommended that to people who really don't know anything about the industrial side of things. You're not going to wow anyone by having that cert, but you might impress someone with a ""Hey I'm new to this industry and I'm motivated, look I'm doing this stuff on my own time"". I've personally recommended this, for example, to the security guards at my site who were interested in moving to the facilities side of things. Start here, get this done, and then we'll talk kind of thing.

* I've been certified by NICET, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless you're looking to do very specific electrical testing: https://www.nicet.org/certification-programs/electrical-and-mechanical-systems/electrical-power-testing/

* I've also been CDCTP certified: https://www.cnet-training.com/the-global-data-centre-network-infrastructure-education-framework/ which is a thing, but I also wouldn't really recommend it, I think.

DataCenter,Thanks a lot. I’m gonna study my ass off this weekend and hopefully I’m offered a position.,1
DataCenter,That is significantly lower (by 4-5 cents per kWh) than wholesale industrial price of power being reported by EIA. Why is that?  Is it because the wholesale price assumes the use of some T&D?,1
DataCenter,"I did the Schneider Electric DCCA certification which was really good material to prepare me for the technical portions and all of the material is free. The exam itself is like $100 but nobody ever told me I needed it. I actually tried to mention I had the cert a few times but no one seemed to care lol.Paul Evans YouTube channel The Engineer Mindset is also an amazing resource and he covers a lot of stuff in this field. 

I took a bunch of notes but honestly the questions they asked were pretty basic mechanical/HVAC/electrical. My advice is to answer the questions as detailed as you can and avoid simple answers. If you don’t know the answer, give it your best guess. 

You definitely want to know the refrigeration cycle and the 4 major components and temperature/state changes in the cycle. Make sure you know how a generator works and all of the major components. Be able to explain purpose and operation of VFD. Know the different types of UPS. Know relative humidity and dew point and relationship with temperature. Brush up on evaporative coolers. Explain D/C voltage and how a battery works. Know your 3-phase A/C and how to measure phases. Know the basic server rack arrangements and how CRAC works. Water chiller and cooling tower components. I never got asked a single question about fire suppression but it’s probably good to know. I’m probably missing some things but these are the major ones. 

They take the LP questions really seriously. I scheduled a few calls with my recruiter to practice some LP questions. 

Feel free to DM me with any more questions. Happy to help.",1
DataCenter,I have worked in cities and this was the standard when I worked there. Hot day with a thin ozone we couldn't run them. We also could only run them between 5-7pm unless it was an emergency. We would do most of our maintenance in the winter. When I moved to NOVA they went off of run hour per company but things have changed more to the EPA standards now.,2
DataCenter,"Hey bro, the I'm former navy I just did interview with Amazon AWS EOT. The refrigeration cycle is a big one, How does a generator create power, checking 480 volts phase to phase -phase to ground, UPS units what's the components, difference between a open vs closed transition, cooling towers, Ohms Law, what a dew point, wet and dry temps, I have study guide I made. After the technical interview the should give you virtual interview after that. One of those guys will ask some more technical questions, and he will probably ask more questions then everybody. If you message me you email I will send you what I made",1
DataCenter,I have heard decently good things about AWS datacenters in my city giving their employees good opportunities to move up between teams when they are ready etc. might change based on management but if this is OP’s best foot in the door at a data center it shouldn’t be hard for them to move up to a data center technician role.,1
DataCenter,What's your current role?,1
DataCenter,"In NOVA, only in the summer season, new sites have to wait till 5:01 pm to run Gens. 

Grandfathered sites around 5+ yrs old are exempt",1
DataCenter,I only have 18 years.  But never worked in VA.,2
DataCenter,"There is a data center practically in my back yard. On the upside, it seems to be blocking some of the wind from the north. It also has motion lights and large security cameras. Low hum on a good day, hardly noticeable or maybe i got used to it, but Quite loud with vibrations felt, when the generator(s) kicks on every once in a while. I am assuming it's a generator or some kind of large cooling system making the racket. It is too loud to comfortably carry on a conversation when outside. Other than that, they have lawn people that keep the area mowed and groomed...i would expect that noise in a residential neighborhood. The large building appears unmarked, and looks very unassuming and blends in with similar structures nearby. The loud sound turns on more frequently on very hot days, or with a power outage. There are very large vents coming out of the side of the building, so i am hoping that whatever is being ventilated is safe. I primarily try to just forget about it otherwise.

There are also some huge vents facing my parking area that might be for ventilation. I have no idea what might be exhausting or exchanged from the building, but i do hope it's safe. Not sure if it is noise related.

I have felt generally very crummy since living here. I have a beautiful place in many ways, but the environment is making me nervous. Edited for clarification",1
DataCenter,Yeah it is L2. I think it comes up at L2 intern or something like that,1
DataCenter,VA but ive never heard this anywhere else I've worked in VA. I've worked mission critical sites for 14 years,1
DataCenter,Oh that sounds like their L2 program they had when I was there,1
DataCenter,"What state would this be?  Each state has their own EPA stuff going on, so it might just be an air pollution/quality thing.",1
DataCenter,I’d imagine it’s company standard. Ours are absolutely only OOH in Scotland. Far as I’m aware there’s not UK standards or legislation.,1
DataCenter,"It’s Work Based Learning Program. AWS offers them a lot, you get 3 months hands on training and get paid like $19-$20/hr or something like that. At the end of training, your manager decides if they want you or not. They used to pay a lot higher till two years ago or so. But since last year or so pay is not as good",1
DataCenter,during summer months (in Virginia) government emissions don't allow you to run generators during the day hours without some kind of emergency. its something like june - sep,1

DataCenter,Congratulations on your imposter syndrome. You'll be fine in a few months.,1
DataCenter,"I am also an auto tech and was an aircraft technician in the Air Force previously and was reached out to by a recruiter as well. I asked her if my experience would actually be a good fit and she said I have the perfect background. I have an interview in a few days but I’m still worried about some of the questions there’re going to ask. 

Is there anything you would advise me to study up on beforehand? And help would be greatly appreciated.",1
DataCenter,Could also be ozone requirements depending on the time of year,2
DataCenter,"Awesome, I’ll be sure to keep questions like that in mind to prep myself more ; 
Thanks!",1
DataCenter,"Is this for Indiana? Sounds like an L4 position.

I've interviewed for Network Deploy Tech and DCO Tech. Both being L3 positions. 

I was asked technical questions such as ""Trouble shoot this: Device A <> Bulk Fiber PP <---> Bulk Fiber PP <> Device B All device configured, fibers & optics patched in. No link light up."" actual question btw. Lots of fiber questions and setting up network devices.  
  
They made a big deal about the leadership principles and the impact you've had in your other positions.",2

DataCenter,Do you know any opening at ur data center? I’m in loudoun/fairfax.  Trying to get a data center technician job. I can send u my new updated resume after work.,-2
DataCenter,"They should go with C. These days, power is the biggest limiting factor, not rack space.

Plus, C keeps the aisles clear and you can route cable tray and such around the column as needed.

Additionally, if you have heavy cabinets, you can put them on that line up and have them over a structural column.",1
DataCenter,And their support is COMPLETELY nonexistent,1
DataCenter,"Another vote for ""A"". 

Area B you may lose space to perform maintenance or install/replace racks and C you lose rack space.",2
DataCenter,https://i.imgur.com/dN2xqGK.png,0
DataCenter,Any time. Other companies run multiple tests a month because they are smaller and usually don't have the redundancy like Data Centers have. The building I am currently in is N+2 for generators and UPS.,1
DataCenter,Okay thanks for the info. I needed that,1
DataCenter,"Depends on the data center and how long it has been there. Most new buildings are required to run them in the evening. Many of the older legacy buildings are grandfathered in before they made those rules, and can run them during the day. I work for a DC in Sterling that is 5+ years old and we run them during the day unloaded once a month. We run them loaded once a year for 2 hours with a vendor onsite.",8
DataCenter,I work with a lot ppl that lack time in the business and thought I was spewing non sense when I told them you can do test and maintenance during the day.,1
DataCenter,It's in Ashburn VA the mecca of data centers. Do you work in a data centers?,0
DataCenter,I have been in a lot of DCs in Loudoun and they test their generators all the time during the day. They will also run off of generators to lessen the load on the power grid during high usage times.,2
DataCenter,"Could be either county regulations or company standards. You're missing a lot of information to have anyone even venture a guess. Also, no idea where that county is. I'm assuming somewhere in the US?",0
DataCenter,Thanks!,1
DataCenter,"You worked at a place for 7yrs and only have three bullet points?

Technical support and help desk support are the same thing. Microsoft windows, team collaboration? None of these are skills. They're things you did at a job.",1
DataCenter,nope,0
DataCenter,Or the all important server lift.,2
DataCenter,Angle trays to run around columns are available.,1
DataCenter,"C.  You won't have clear access to front (4 feet from front to front) in a cold aisle or rear (three to four feet back to back typically) hot aisle.  This could block access to as many as four racks and could prevent access to part of a row entirely.  C blocks out two racks from the footprint.  If possible, I would shift the rack row so the column fits in the footprint of one rack.",1
DataCenter,"I wouldn't want to fight a column trying to rack a server. B is completely out. A is also troubling, you can't get rear doors open and I spend most of my time in the back of my racks where all the networking and power is. I spent maybe 20 minutes a year on the front of my rack. Might as well take out a couple rack spaces and do C.",1
DataCenter,"I agree as well. I've been in quite a few DCs, and A is the most common I've seen.",2
DataCenter,"Depends on the hosts in the rack, really, but A would be my default in my experience. Host maintenance mostly happens in the cold isles, you need space to pull the blades out. Cabling is typically in the front as well. Bus bar or PSU hosts really don't need that much space to work on in the hot isles.",1
DataCenter,"If I had to choose I'd probably go this route as well - you usually load from the front and need more manouvering room on that side, and for cabling or PDU swaps you can probably make do with some tight spaces here and there...",2
DataCenter,"It all depends on sizes and details unfortunately

A maximizes rack footprints and can make the cold aisle smaller to get more aisles in. 

However what racks are you using, the APC racks with two doors on the back would be better for access, a single door is going to mean some racks not accessible from back. 

B is an issue because you need to go with a wide cold aisle. Also most of not all equipment loads in from the front so you need enough space to get stuff into the rack. 


C is fine but try to arrange to take out 1 rack or even but the racks up against either side of it. You could put one on either side of the hot aisle as well aligned with the front of the racks then you could have different spacing in ready of hall. 

Can be used to brace containment as well.",1
DataCenter,Got the recruiter s contact info,1
DataCenter,Thank you very much,1
DataCenter,Is it raised floor or slab?,1
DataCenter,Anywhere except C. - Chief Revenue Officer.,1
DataCenter,I’m 3 months into the SDR Job,1
DataCenter,"B, C, then A. 

B works if you have very wide cold aisles, you need to be able to pull servers out of racks and move service carts beside it. Must consider how air flows to the racks, does it blow down the row or is it fed from a duct above.

C, will lose two rack positions, but be out of the way. Ideal if your rows are tight.

A, depends how your hac is setup, if there is vertical space for air to move up to the air inlet rather than across/down the aisle. This also works well for some of the OCP customers that have minimal need to service the rear of the rack.",2
DataCenter,"Depends on how wide your hot aisle is, your cabling strategy, and if it’s just one column per row or multiple.",1
DataCenter,A because you’re not blocking the aisle or taking up rack space,2
DataCenter,"> If you went with C, you can't run the telecoms tray, fibrerunner or busbars through.

Here's [a Panduit catalog](https://www.panduit.com/content/dam/panduit/en/solutions/ni-catalog-2023-web-cpcb295-sa-eng.pdf) for fiber runners and trays (starting on p120). I order this stuff all the time. It's annoying because you're adding more parts to a project, but the end result looks beautiful (as it should).",3
DataCenter,"Keep the bus bar out to the side and use 90 or 45 degree bends to get around the column. 

I see this in lease sites all the time.",2
DataCenter,"Ah, I've worked in data halls where despite rows having 48"" of clearance, it wasn't enough. Designers forgot to take into consideration how much space is needed when removing racks which involves turning it.",3
DataCenter,"a if you have doors on both ends (but blades that slide out the rear may be an issue.

  
c if your running sub 10kw per rack. As you can go way more dense so the racks loss is not a big issue more power for the racks next to it.

B will cause issues removeing servers hard no on it

So i woudl say C",2
DataCenter,"Eh, a 6, maybe? It was not hard at all, just long since it was a loop. You have nothing to lose by going through the interview. If anything, you gain experience for the next time if you fail this time.

 Quiet is better than brash. Just mention that it takes you a moment to answer open-ended questions. The technical wasn't hard either if you have some IT experience, just don't B.S. your answers, say you don't know but would be open to learning. As for the leadership questions, I was pulling stories from my retail days over 10 years ago, so again, just be truthful.",1
DataCenter,"It seems like all the in rack CDUs are adjustable for bottom or top, which only makes it more challenging to arrive at an industry standard. I personally think everything should come from above, but that's just me.",1
DataCenter,"B as long as there's 36-48"" of clearance between rack and column.

A results in blocking your access to the rear of the racks. C results in loss of rack space since you can't put racks that close to a column.",1
DataCenter,"I've been in hundreds of data centers globally, and I can say that in my experience I've mostly encountered structural columns in hot aisles. It's mostly just an air handling space when everything is operational, so it'll be mostly out of the way in position A.",5
DataCenter,"I agree more info would be needed.
But based on the limited info B would be your best bet if the diagram is true to size.
Are we looking at cages on each side or are they bulk heads?
 ""A"" would be completely out of the question...heat dissipation would be an issue.
""C"" you would cost you 2 cabinets.",1
DataCenter,"If your diagram is reasonably to-scale I would pick C. You could pick A if access is possible from either end, but it's going to be very annoying. B is possible if there is more than 1 full rack depth of clearance from the front of the rack to the edge of the column, otherwise you can't pull the servers out and you need to take away those 4 cabinets.

You will have to lose cabinets in any instance here. You might get away with having some cabinets that are only for half-depth gear but full-depth is out of the question. Obviously you will have to blank off any removed cabinets from the design to prevent air leakage.",4
DataCenter,"Adding column, reduces span, which reduces beam sizes over the Data Hall, which increases clear head height and saves money.",1
DataCenter,Nope. Real life Data Centre Designer. Sketch is crap cos I can't share too much detail. I've built DCs before for big client who have no columns at all in the Data Hall. My current client is pushing for columns to reduce spans and save money. I'm just trying to find the best solution for a bad preference. Maximise the racks has always been my main driver. I might push back to see if we can span the whole hall.,3
DataCenter,Vertiv has an off the shelf solution with documentation on their website.,1
DataCenter,A so you don't lose rack positions and you can still keep cable trays straight.,5
DataCenter,Current interview role is also of PM? With which org?,1
DataCenter,Same here. I double-checked that all course content is marked up as completed...but nothing happens,1
DataCenter,"Also one more thing to consider is the building code.   
  
Usually when the data halls are designed the cold aisle width is specified based on the minimum width that is required by code for egress( for people to walk and operate). If you place a column at the center of that aisle you may be violating the building code.",6
DataCenter,"This seems like a school project question, but I'll bite.  The entire facility is typically designed around the devices in the racks - maximizing them, maximizing the profit on them, cooling them, powering them, etc..  I feel like any solution that decreases the rack count would make the beancounters' heads explode.  Rack space ain't cheap...


Meaning inconveniences and workarounds are probably preferable to decreasing the usable rack space, but that's just like my opinion man ...",3
DataCenter,"Depends on the distance between B and the cabinets, if you can’t get a server lift in there those cabinets are limited to small devices, which might be fine if the customer is okay with it, the other spots just straight up remove cabinets or limit connectivity between cabinets.",2
DataCenter,"Also, if you have the column in A or B you wont be able to move a pallet or equipment down that row.",3
DataCenter,"Interesting. The design should have thought of all the loads needed for the white space. Especially since this is the money making space. 

Specifically why do you need to add one?",1
DataCenter,"I've been in sites that have a column in the middle of rows of cabs, yeah you lose space but trying to work around columns in hot or cold rows are a real pain in the ass. I'd much rather have them out of the way.",7
DataCenter,Get angles for the trays and go around it. You can attach them to the column,8
DataCenter,"If you went with C, you can't run the telecoms tray, fibrerunner or busbars through. Is that ok? Can the trays/busbars come from either end and just stop at the column?",2
DataCenter,"B would make the most sense if space isn't an issue. Kinda hard to give OP a correct answer without specs.

Granted commercial DC's have more space, I think you'd get some funny looks if you laid out your aisles with columns at A/C",9
DataCenter,Thanks for your reply. I’m aware of redundancy and work loads etc. I generally use 60% of the vendors max draw but have found many times this can be misleading when dealing with AI and ML machines. I’m looking for someone that’s running one of these beasts.,1
DataCenter,"On a scale of say 1-10 how hard was the interview? 

I have a virtual interview coming up… But at this point, I may just back out to not waste their time. My soft skills are terrible, shy and extremely quiet, so I’m probably going to fail at the leadership stuff. :/ 

What is the technical questions like?",1
DataCenter,"I would say ""C"". 

If you put it at ""A"" it would interfere with 4 cabinets, Location ""B"" would make 4 cabinets severely limited in their use (Large devices might not be able to be racked). While you lose 2 cabinets with ""C"" it makes all the other cabs still fully usable.",17
DataCenter,Is it not dielectric liquid?,1
DataCenter,I did go through the interview and got an offer afterwards. It's been an interesting experience so far.,1
DataCenter,"I understand if data center already has a raised floor and is adapting, this is where they would install piping, though newer facilites which tend to be for large scale operators, are opting for above piping and no raised floor.",1
DataCenter,"If you have a old machine or laptop you don't mind wiping, I would suggest an easy linux project. Most people setup Plex Media Servers with linux on old unused machines. There are tons of Youtube videos you can use to follow along. 

Doing this, you'll start learning basic Linux commands and flow. Then just keep being curious and trying/checking things. This is what I did. 

Good luck.",1
DataCenter,"I also appeared for PM position here recently.
You are interviewing for which org?",1
DataCenter,"PM means Product Manager?
DMed you",1
DataCenter,I got bumped out by an internal employee’s promotion. Site manager was nice and sent me another few openings to apply. I’m currently interviewing another 2 jobs with Msft. That was a PM role.,1
DataCenter,"Nlyte is defo one to consider. They do have options for subscription as well as perpetual and their bulk tools are probably one of the best. Additionally, the API's that come with Nlyte are definitely top notch and full loaded, making it easier to integrate with lots of other tools too. It's not free, but it's definitely worth considering",1
DataCenter,"Nlyte can do forecasting too, can set start times for the project and completion dates too etc. Part of their standard NAO offering",1
DataCenter,"If there's more money in the new role, I'd take it. You'll gain new experience and make more money, setting you up for the next job.

Unless there's a defined path in your current role to quickly advance, keep looking elsewhere.",1
DataCenter,"I was asking about fully liquid cooled, either DLC or RDHx. No hot aisle containment.",1
DataCenter,No one in their right mind is doing raised floors anymore. Pipes go in the hot aisle.,-1
DataCenter,"I presume what is meant is not that air is used as a fire suppression mechanism, but to keep the sprinkler pipes dry.",1

DataCenter,"Hi there, can you elaborate a bit more on this projects?
My company is selling IT and data center infrastructure to customers and I want to be on top of the new high density cooling technologies.

I'm curious to know what products you've used, whether it was installed in an existing space alongside ordinary servers or in a new site, starting from scratch.

I'd appreciate your feedback",-1
DataCenter,"I am into that business in emerging markets. The first thing would be to go through a complete due diligence and understand the cost to put everything back in shape and meet a decent uptime. Considering the datacenter age, you may be looking at replacing all the batteries...
Plus, check the annual maintenance costs related to running the facility.
Connectivity is super important for a datacenter so you would have to check what fiber is currently running to your datacenter and if there's any backbone nearby.",1
DataCenter,How do you like it so far? I have my final interviews in the morning,1
DataCenter,"AI is dramatically reshaping power design, with 80-100KW racks setting a new standard. As industry experts, we recognize the profound implications for facility management and the urgent need for advanced, scalable solutions.

**Generator Backup:** The 8x to 10x surge in power density necessitates robust generator backups. This isn't merely an upgrade; it's akin to building a grid-scale power infrastructure within your facility. Ensuring continuous power supply is critical, especially given the high computational demands of AI.



**UPS for ITE Power Feeds:** The decision to maintain UPS on ITE power feeds is pivotal. While some may forgo UPS on ITE, it's imperative to place CDUs on UPS, assuming the CHW has UPS support. This strategy safeguards against power fluctuations, ensuring stable and reliable operations.



Incorporating these solutions can substantially enhance power resilience and operational efficiency, enabling facilities to meet the rigorous demands of AI-driven workloads effectively. As a leading IT Infrastructure and Telecom Company, [MAPL World](https://in.linkedin.com/company/maplworld) emphasizes the importance of forward-thinking strategies to navigate these challenges.",1
DataCenter,"Fire code in most places (at least the us) require sprinklers, even if you have an inert system as well. Preaction sprinkler systems meet fire code even though water is not always in the sprinkler system overhead.",1
DataCenter,I have implemented 3 of these now. 2  proprietary solutions and 1 is an off the shelf solution. It is just easier to do it above as below usually requires raised floor which adds maintenance costs to the overall build.,2
DataCenter,Which data center?,1
DataCenter,Would you mind sharing what your pay was or if you’d rather DM me that’s fine as well. I did not know that MS offered this so I am open to learning. Thanks!,1
DataCenter,"Affirmative, thanks for the advice",1
DataCenter,Ask questions and show curiosity (Growth Mindset).,1
DataCenter,"Review how Tier 3 data center works. UPS,Generator,Switchgears,power distribution basic knowledge should help. Safety practices is also a must. Focus on the things you are already familiar with.",3
DataCenter,"I’m not in NoVa, I’m from NJ but I’m open to relocate. My WBLP was in Sterling. I moved there temporarily for 3 months but when they told me full time will be $22/hr, I said no thanks and came back. I was already making 22 and was working from home, doing same now as well.",2
DataCenter,"Besides considering contracting or scoring an internship as a way in, I don’t have any other tips. 

But I can say they will continue hiring aggressively thru the end of the year for DCT’s so keep checking their postings.",1
DataCenter,"Are you in Nova? I passed on the WBLP, ended up with a paid internship at Microsoft thru the Nova Data Center Academy as it was my fastest hope of getting in with low experience. It’s paying off better than I ever imagined.",1
DataCenter,"Look up what Columbus, oh looks like in Ready Player One. It will be that way in 20 years.",1
DataCenter,"Hey, any tips on getting interview at Microsoft? I did WBLP program at AWS but due to very low pay I decided not to take full time position. Been trying to find something else since then but no luck. Have applied at multiple positions at Google, Microsoft, Equinox, etc but nothing",1
DataCenter,The relevance is water above critical equipment. A wet sprinkler system above is not recommended above critical equipment so logically you wouldn’t want to put water above for cooling.  Some data centers do not want the extra cost of a nitrogen generator.  An inert gas serves the same purpose as air (no water in the system.). The advantage of nitrogen is that it is less corrosive to the pipes over time and will extend their life.,3
DataCenter,"Hey, did you have your virtual interview yet? How did it go?",1
DataCenter,Can concur was not asked any tech questions and I'm FT,2
DataCenter,"Not disagreeing with you from a leak detection standpoint, but what is the relevance of fire suppression? Also, I would think most new builds are inert gas, no air which would suggest oxygen.",1
DataCenter,"I’m sure it would be preferred to have the chilled water lines below the equipment.  Leak detection is easier to implement.  That’s why pre-action fire systems are used (no water in the sprinkler pipes, just air or nitrogen.)",6
DataCenter,The company the OP works for is an Italian firm well known in the industry.,1
DataCenter,"As per others there isn’t much technician questions per se but more like what happens X, Y scenario, how well you fit in, its opposite of technical abilities but more of communication and getting along with others and how you resolve conflicts as well.",3
DataCenter,**Also if there are other factors I should factor in or consider as negotiable please let me know! Thx 💪🏾,1
DataCenter,"I interviewed today as a DCT. Didn’t get asked a single technical question whatsoever. It was just a natural free flowing conversation. Also no behavioral STARR method questions. Very refreshing especially since I’m coming in data center work with no hands on experience, only certs. 

Be familiar with how to insert parts of your narrative and personality into the STARR method questions that will be asked of you on the behavioral side. 

On the technical side be ready to discuss your understanding of the particular electromechanical systems you have used in the past. Also a good conversation point for a CET is asking more about current cooling methods onsite and also for upcoming builds. 

Last thing: ALWAYS ask your prospective manager what are their most pressing pain points and if they could wave a wand, ask them what they would immediately change. This will give you an opportunity to be a problem solver, and likely open up the interviewer to a more meaningful conversation. 

From what I’ve heard and now seen firsthand, the Microsoft interview experience is very generous in not applying pressure or asking any “gotcha questions”. 

They look for integrity, cultural fit, and growth mindset above rigid skills. You can be taught anything.

Truly be yourself, don’t send “your representative”.",5
DataCenter,"Hey OP, I'm about to hit my second round of interviews for the same position at an L4. Would you mind DMing what they offered you? I prepped for two days for the phone screen and I'll be prepping for the 4 interviews very extensively, I've got so much operational experience though I'm gonna have to meditate to remember everything I've taken care of and fixed at my other positions lol.",1
DataCenter,Thank you so much. 🙏 ,1
DataCenter,"I was recently hired by Microsoft in an IT role, and during my interview, I wasn't asked a single technical question. I was hoping I was because I felt I would have crushed it. I soon found out that what's more important than what you know is how you fit into the family culture. 

Be yourself, be genuine.",12
DataCenter,"OP. Are you an appraiser? Just curious. Im a CG and am interested in appraising data center, etc.",1
DataCenter,"This is VERY country and region specific. In the US... Maybe. In Europe, especially where free cooling etc is a thing, you will find different price structures. In Africa the largest DC operators are building solar farms and wheeling into the grid, again with varying price structures depending on what they are pumping into the grid",1
DataCenter,"Cool story, tell it again",-1
DataCenter,Do you know any startups working on new solutions?,1
DataCenter,"If those are redundant power supplies, figure that half of them can power the entire machine. You will need to measure the equipment in order to get an accurate idea. Otherwise it's just guessing. The specific configuration and usage patterns will dictate the usage. It might be a lot less than you think depending on workload.",2
DataCenter,It's a chill job. You will be working closely with security. You will be removing old cable from racks and leave them hanging with red velcro and then you remove the racks as a whole and shrink wrap them for moves to other sites or to get fully decommissioned. I would not recommend staying on that team more than a year or so as you won't really learn anything. Head to dco or deploy if you can. Good luck,1
DataCenter,Sorry to hear that happened to you. There's also Schneider and Eaton to name a few.,1
DataCenter,Speak of anything you are working on. I had the CCP and A+ coming from a non related field and they hired me as a L3 DCO. If you can get a college email address CompTIA has an academic store where the certs vouchers are about half off,1
DataCenter,Electricity prices are nowadays passed through by data center providers to tenants. Usually no electricity price risk for DC these days.,1
DataCenter,"The Hyperscalers are paying 2.5 to 3.5 cents per kilowatt hour for their electricity.

Most if not all have it in their contracts with colo providers AND will help said providers get the price down through their bulk purchase agreements.",1
DataCenter,"Customer involved in leaving them. We ended up with them as part of an acquisition. Run away. Fast. The company's enshitification has been breath taking in the scope and pace. The company they bought - ""Edge Hosting"" had a moto about getting more sleep because their managed services were that good. They were not lying. They had really good people and were impressive enough that the rest of the company began looking at them. Databank on the other hand - I was up since 11PM because they spontaneously corrupted 2 production VMs. The only explanation from support was ""We can restore"".  Their after hours support is mostly third party. We have experienced multiple severe outages and what I consider relationship ending events. They can't even figure out billing. Sometimes it's under. Most of the time it is over. Our TAM is always in hiding.   Databank is textbook enshitification.",1
DataCenter,"Quick question, how long it takes them for calling you back after your interview? For giving you the result of your interview? Like a week or more than that?",1
DataCenter,"AWS security policies make it really, really easy to mess up.


Who can forget the hot dog incident?",1
DataCenter,"AWS security policies make it really, really easy to mess up.


Who can forget the hot dog incident?",1
DataCenter,"Decommissioning at AWS is the latter, not the former.",4
DataCenter,DECOM is barely an IT job. It honestly has more to do with inventory management than IT. Once you get in immediately get out into another department like DCO or Install.,1
DataCenter,"Did you write a piece on living near data centers? There is a bid to build one right behind my house, 100-200 feet away. I’m trying to prepare for it. Thanks.",1
DataCenter,"Hi, I would like to ask if u need A+ cert or you can just study about it? The certificate is quite expensive for my 3rd world salary haha. Currently I'm trying to get Amazon cloud practitioner since it's cheaper and to build up some resume to be able to get at least an interview haha.",1
DataCenter,I think they can just get away with it. It seems like since the layoff that they changed starting pays. Though... I may be wrong and that may have been an L2 position. But I can't find the information about it anymore. I am going to try to get into a position like that after I see what Tom team is all about. I would rather be in IT but want some experience with the truck driving just to have it under my belt.,0
DataCenter,"Oh wow they just emailed me to let me know they went with someone else.
They strung me alomg for 3 weeks maiking it seem like I really impressed them but oh well shit happens. Who/what are other companies that do UPS work? I'm intrigued by it and want to see more options.",1
DataCenter,My recruiter called and told me,1
DataCenter,"CompTIA Project+, AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, and Itil 4 Foundation. I don't think these really helped all too much though, knowing now what the job entails. Although I did hear someone mention the CompTIA a+ is good, I haven't looked into it too much myself but it looks like it could be useful.",1
DataCenter,"You'll be fine. Worked in FAANG last couple of decades. My current manager, started in decom. after a couple years moved to Placement. Now he's my boss.  I always tell new to ITers, get your foot in the door, show up on time, don't be an ahole, write your own ticket.",1
DataCenter,If by chance you are to be hired understand that the culture there is one of “go and figure it out.” So if you’re lucky enough to find a decent trainer/mentor consider yourself blessed,2
DataCenter,"Tell the recruiter you are working on the A+ and more interested in a DCO role. Seriously, decom is for people who don't know what a CPU is coming into the door.",7
DataCenter,"wholesale prices are negotiable depending on your expected volumes, etc.",1
DataCenter,What other certs do you have?,1
DataCenter,How do you know if you passed ?,1
DataCenter,"Unracking, removing media, destroying media, bag and tag.

Easy role to get into and opens you doors for better roles inside the DC environment",2
DataCenter,Having your own substation and the quantity of power you buy is pretty much all that matters for most commercial power pricing. Having your own substation and being able to take power at transmission voltage is really the only thing that can improve power pricing except hedging the power procurement markets and getting lucky.,2
DataCenter,I thought about going for Amazon but their locations are as numerous as google yet and I think I'll like the culture of google much better hopefully.,2
DataCenter,"I also just interviewed for that position, from what I know you would be working with hardware parts such as CPU RAM HDD and SSD’s. Also fiber and copper cabling",1
DataCenter,"ChilliRack air-cooling technology is available now.

The system creates a full cold and hot air containment system inside the rack.

It's compatible with all existing IT equipment and is available for purchase now.

www.chillirack.com",1
DataCenter,"The data center where I got my first job they hired people with zero experience as they often care more about being able to lift 50lbs, especially on decommissioning, most complex thing someone will do decommissioning is wiping network data off switches and routers but I can almost promise they won’t be having an entry level person doing this, and the lack of job duties leads to a high turnover so I wouldn’t stress, they need you more than you need them",2
DataCenter,Can confirm it's basically taking racks offline and destroying media when necessary.,13
DataCenter,Also what’s crazy is that even your recruiter can recommend you and the hiring manager will choose if they want to proceed forward. It’s unfair to those that have an internal person pushing them forward.,1
DataCenter,I can't offer any insight but not gonna lie that sounds like a pretty cool job and a good way to get into the DC world like already stated.,1
DataCenter,"Exactly, I think our only hope is to wait for a new location to open up so that multiple positions becomes available. Right now it seems the only few positions goes to internal candidates.",2
DataCenter,"I'm going for the Clarksville location, it's kind of the deal sealer for me to go G over Amazon.",1
DataCenter,"So, if the starting point of this companies is wholesale prices what would be the build up to reach the data center electricity price?",1
DataCenter,You won’t be messing with servers or anything (besides taking them apart) so you can’t really fuck up. DCO is the team that works in their racks,5
DataCenter,"It's purely based on the contract you get with the power company.  They don't care how efficient you are, just how many units you want and how much you're going to pay per unit.  Also they may have other stipulations like if you're going to cut power that you stage things in a way that their substation doesn't go kablammey.",6
DataCenter,"Oh yeah. It does seem like a but if an excessive wait. But who knows what their process is. I know im already feeling impatient, and I've been waiting for half the time you have. Mind if I ask what site you're getting into?",1
DataCenter,"I don't have any specific knowledge of Amazon's definition of a 'decommissioning technician', but sounds like you will be doing one of two things. 

- The whole datacenter is being decommissioned and you will be working to unrack all the servers and equipment, removing all cabling, etc. Basically, get everything ready to move out of the building

- or you'll be tasked with decommissioning specific hardware. You might have to unrack servers and harvest good components from the servers. Destroy hard drives. Things like that. 

Either way, it looks like its a good way to get into the datacenter industry. Get some experience and move-on to better companies.",15
DataCenter,The issue is that even if you passed; the hiring manager personally chooses who they want to do a fit call with. That sucks because it really is up to luck at that point. you could be waiting with 18 other people for the fit call but the manager wants to only interview 5 people and hire 2.,1
DataCenter,"Literally and honestly, walk in with your nuke cert from the Navy and start talking signing bonuses.  Your background is HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER because they know you know how to follow and possibly create procedures.

I would not accept a position under Director level with a Navy Nuke on my resume. 

Negotiate well, you deserve every dollar coming your way.",1
DataCenter,Yeah I ping my recruiter like twice a week and she tells me their still reviewing. Idk how long that process takes but it seems a touch excessive IMO,2
DataCenter,"PUE doesn't affect the price per kwh but would affect how much the bill is at the end if the month as you may use more electricity than needed..

Most large colos buy energy in the markets and buy it ahead of time with forcasts of what they are Likley to use. 

They don't buy it like we do in our residential properties and at the prices we are Likley to.",9
DataCenter,"Power sources, fossil, hydro, wind, LNG etc. Ambient yearly temp of the location (impacts PUE). Cooling type. And if you want to be fancy add WUE.",2
DataCenter,"Awesome, im in the same boat and wasn't sure if I was being impatient or not. I got the go ahead about a week ago from the HM but they said they still needed to get approvals. I feel I may have to push back my start date of I don't get the offer soon.",2
DataCenter,"I am serious, I wish I am not. I am calculating IT loads in excess of 500KVA(DC) + maybe around 300 KVA(Lab and others). Good to know those X\_weeks you mentioned as we can potentially generate realistic timelines for our delivery. I've also heard from a local vendor(Canada) that wait times is now in 1year+ for those Vertiv DX models(which I really like).",1
DataCenter,"Believe it or not, still waiting haha. They said it would be like a week and that was 2 weeks ago.",2
DataCenter,Get your Netflix subscription. Jk,1
DataCenter,"I just started about a week ago. I bought the udemy basic to power user course which was highly rated. 

I am having a blast and am about halfway through. Will it teach you everything? Absolutely not, but it helped me setup my own VM with Ubuntu learning a lot of basic commands. How to combine command and how to search what to do with them. Best part is when things aren't working I get to troubleshoot how to get it working myself, ie shared folders and compatibility issues with an outdated comp. When it works after an hour of trying it's so satisfying.",2
DataCenter,"Yup I got the Google cert, my resume is in my post history if u wanna look at it.",1
DataCenter,"You need massibe power. You either have to build a data center by a substation or you build a substation by a data center. That said, you also need to talk to utility companies. I'm just a lineman. That's all I know🤣",1
DataCenter,"Cx guy here. 

Understand your commissioning process and communicate with the team to understand your limits of power and cooling. 

Especially when it comes to operational testing as opposed to Cx testing.",1
DataCenter,"Hey, just a question for you. How long did it take them to get your offer to you from when the HM said they wanted to move forward to offer?",2
DataCenter,"You being serious?  I can't speak to the availability of server/storage/network gear, but if you need Power infrastructure in capacities over 1MW, you're going to have a hard time getting transformers, switchgear (72 weeks), UPS (20 weeks) PDU's (20-52 weeks), RPP's (20-52 weeks).  Some of the cooling is more available depending on the mode of heat rejection you use (DX / CW / WC) but still at least 20 weeks out.

What size DC are we talking about here? (in terms of total IT load)",1
DataCenter,He's colour blind,1
DataCenter,Sent you a pm!,2
DataCenter,sent you a pm!,1
DataCenter,"From a facility prospective in a UK colo it's like 0.4 per MW. From a scale network prospective it's usually done by the customer and they usually won't be on site every day and it's usally only 1 of them unless they are deploying or removing racks. 

When it's like Google or aws own data center they run much more staff - colos are trying to make a marjin",1
DataCenter,"Welcome to the team 👍🏼

What’s your background?

Show up on time, learn as much as you can about the site your based at and data centres in general.",1
DataCenter,Don't press anything with a red button!,2
DataCenter,"That really is dependant on the firm, don't feel you can generalise for the whole industry. I hate firms that promise a 'future promotion' either you are good enough for the promotion or you are not. 

Personally I would take the new position, but without knowing the job roles in each its difficult to say.",1
DataCenter,"I work at a btc data center. We're completely remodeling sites to run hpc instead of btc. They are tearing down buildings to the foundation and frames and rebuilding from there. We do air cooling so our walls are basically chicken wire.

They are planning on adding generators and ups. we have no redundancy now.",1
DataCenter,Much harder to radiate heat in the vacuum,2
DataCenter,"Are we not talking about wild ideas here? There was Japanese paper about a superconducting ring. I just want to harden that idea for war. Any SciFi about settling the solar system involves war. Of course I would start with the Japanese article. But over the years a network of conductors need to be built for redundancy. Ion mass spectrometry to separate all radioactive material which would introduce heat or disturb computers. Build and dig structures to absorb any sound and shock wave using magnetic dampers which create electricity. So an asteroid will destroy local memory, but provide power for the larger region.

Can I have a slingshot? A ring maglev travelling at orbital velocity. Suck away the atmosphere into tanks. So space ships can land and depart no problem. Asteroid mining and shooting trash back in return.

Finally, fusion and fission reactors could be fed with all unwanted elements and isotopes. Have a big cave for bombs. Like this laser thing in Stanford.",1
DataCenter,Are the interviews still going on for India positions?  My recruiter told me that they are done as of jow,1
DataCenter,"Don’t take L3. Don’t let the recruiter push that on you.


Any nuke can be L4.



If you don’t know, ask.",0
DataCenter,I'm just going to put it this way You're nuke and Navy You're probably going to get it whether you know it or not. It just seems like everybody that I work with is former nuke so good luck,0
DataCenter,"Knowing how to subnet ipv4 in your head using slash notation is handy.

Most folks teach it poorly because they never figured out the secret.",2
DataCenter,"Look up the data center nukes page on Facebook, there's a bunch of study material. You could probably get a referral there too. The network is the most valuable part of being a nuke, utilise it",1
DataCenter,"Do you have any certs? Like Google IT cert, Comptia A+ or Net+?   I got rejected (even with referrals) until I got the Google IT cert. I then got an email from a recruiter immediately. I got the other certs and that helped a lot in the interview process.",2
DataCenter,All the rebels realizing they just destroyed the data center housing their favorite streaming sites,1
DataCenter,"52+ weeks? FFFFFFck! Wel havent decided on our servers yet, and we are due to deliver a Data center 3/2026 from a retrofitted office building.",1
DataCenter,"I would guess you got hired because you had working experience with UPS,Gens,motors,AC, etc. Just familiriaze on how the power/AC system work. In Equinix, there are BIG with documentation and procedures. The are a lot to learn but they hired you to make sure to make sure that the lights and cold air are always ON. If you know how to do that, you should be fine.",2
DataCenter,Facility Ops or production? How many on the other side?,1
DataCenter,I got downgraded to a L3 before my loop interview lol,1
DataCenter,I posted up here and there was some stuff posted on my post if you search my name if that helps,1
DataCenter,cool mars down so it superconducts... thats a wild idea,1
DataCenter,"Good question, there’s a data center that opened that’s the first one with nuclear power",1
DataCenter,"* Show up on time to your shift.

* Be polite.

If you can do those three things, you'll go far in this industry.",3
DataCenter,Toxic.  Goodbye.,2
DataCenter,"If you need to force yourself, remove you primary computers ssd/hdd drive pop a fresh one in there then install arch or gentoo and get the desktop gui running. Then use it daily you will get good at how the cli works:)

DataCenter,You still have useless information.. you never answered the question…you should be banned,0
DataCenter,"""In the datacenter"" and what the techs use are two different things, sir.  Regardless of where you worked.  Those thousands of machines are running something, and if it's in a datacenter the odds are they're not Windows servers.  Most customer loads that require a datacenter aren't going to be able to run in a VM on a single machine.",1
DataCenter,"Hahaha they don’t, that’s what they offer in the VM which means you as a customer has access to.. they do not utilize Linux as a Datacenter Technician… you are messaging with someone who left there about 2 months ago… THEY DO NOT USE LINUX… duh … tell me where and show us all where it says that DCT’s use Linux in their Datacenter??",1
DataCenter,Microsoft is lying?  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/blog/2015/05/06/microsoft-loves-linux/,1
DataCenter,This is exactly what I did. I overprepared and was able to answer any questions they threw at me. Fortunately the fit call portion is the most painful part as you will wait a long time due to little openings and a deck full of passed candidates in the same situation.,3
DataCenter,Can I see ur resume? I applied to the same position but got dropped,1
DataCenter,"The first few questions were Fiber Optic Questions, and then mostly terms like DNS, DHCP, UDP. Mostly terms. Hope that helps!",1
DataCenter,"Can you recall what subjects or topics they asked in reference to networking? 

Thanks.",1
DataCenter,"Latency is probably not the primary concern for these applications, but bandwidth (all those cameras capture a lot of data) and security (hospitals have strict data security rules, often to the point of on-premise DCs) can drive edge AI demand",2
DataCenter,"I am not 100% sure about Google or Microsoft, but yes a lot of bigger data centers use Linux and want their techs to know Linux. I messed up 2 interviews for Fortune 500 companies because I didn't know Linux well enough. Linux and scripting. There is definitely a huge demand for it in DC.",1

From there I would either make a bootable thumb drive with a Debian based (which Google uses) distro on it and do some free trainings you find around the web on that, or take an old machine and put Linux on it or Raspberry Pi and use that. The distro isn't super important though since the open source tools you'll need to know work across all the distros.",2
DataCenter,Learn about Internet Interconnection - that is Equinix's actual business.,4
DataCenter,Haha no they do not in the datacenter… they have their own tooling they use.. if someone told you that they lying,0
DataCenter,If you really want to learn and pass the Interview look for something like a Linux+ Certification.  That will at least give you a good foundation and direction on what you want to study.,2
DataCenter,Like in the Datacenter based work?  Because they definitely do.,-1
DataCenter,I cannot stress how much ChatGPT helped. Especially talking out my answers. I would copy 10 questions or so and ask it to ask me each question and let me answer and correct me if I got something wrong. This helped me lock my answers down and feel confident during the interviews. I imagine you have a couple of weeks before the interview. Practice every day!,2
DataCenter,"Whats your pay scale for this job? I’ll be a CFT at my company soon and we’re on the smaller side, especially compared to Equinix.

If you don’t mind me asking ofc",1
DataCenter,"Why does it need to use renewable energy? Those take up enormous amounts of space - especially solar even more so if it's a planet further away from the sun than Earth. Wind is also precarious as it's not only requires a planet with an atmosphere, but one that has reasonable, but not excessive winds - and it's still variable. Plus, the atmosphere could actually be caustic to lightweight materials we would want to use for the windmills.

Why not use the best energy density and something that can be used regardless of how far from the sun, whether there is an atmosphere and whether that atmosphere is stable or caustic or not? Just use nuclear.",1
DataCenter,"I got the job and I’ve been here 3 weeks now. The main stuff to focus on is electric principles like Ohms Law, difference between AC/DC power, volts/amps, Line to neutral voltage of transformer (277V) and Line to Line (480V). Also some plumbing related questions like what is a P Trap, what is GPM (gals per min) Lots of acronym related questions like RPM, BTU, CFM.

The hardest section for me was mechanical and HVAC questions so you need to know the process of the cooling cycle and its components: Evaporator- Compressor- Condenser- Expansion Valve and how they work. I had 3 interviewers and 1 focused on electrical, the other on mechanical, and the third was strictly Leadership questions. 

Hope this helps!",1
DataCenter,Thanks I did really good on the interview answered almost all the questions correctly,2
DataCenter,"The biggest problem here is that most solutions require more electricity, which is a huge expense for a datacenter.  The bang for your buck for power vs. effectiveness is pretty high with liquid cooling.",2
DataCenter,"Thanks alot for your answer! I do like to over prepare abit just incase, but atleast it sounds like im on the right track, just need to read up on some of the stuff in rusty in :D 

Will definitely take your idea and use ChatGPT ;)",2
DataCenter,Just install Linux!,4
DataCenter,"It’s sad right, pigeonhole  your techs to not being the standard across the board..",3
DataCenter,"While I can’t go deeply into the questions themselves (they make you sign an NDA), I will say most of the questions I was asked I found in forums or sites like Reddit and Glassdoor.

I had prepared heavily for Linux questions and scripting and I believe I was asked 2 or 3 questions total on Linux. Nothing on scripting. The OS  and hardware interview was based around the components of a server, OSI model, raid, where log files are in Linux.. and a couple troubleshooting questions like “your computer doesn’t turn on, what do you do to troubleshoot?”.

The googley interview is asking a lot of “tell me about a time…” questions. They were far less technical and seemed more to see what your leadership style is like… how you work with others, etc.

The network interview was very rapid fire questions for me. Asking about a lot of general networking knowledge (DHCP, DNS,) and troubleshooting questions about what to check if devices aren’t talking on a network. 

Nearly every question I was asked was on Reddit or Glassdoor… I prepared for all of them (especially the harder concepts) only to not be asked a ton of hard ones. Better to over prepare! Every interview is a little different as the interviewers could be from anywhere in the company and everyone has a different interview style. The googley interview questions.. I didn’t find a ton of questions specific to this role online. But if you use ChatGPT, have it ask you questions in that style.. that prepared me for a lot of what they’re looking for.

I had a great batch of interviewers and passed. It was very conversational and if I didn’t know something, I explained how I would get the answer. So don’t panic!

Good luck!",9
DataCenter,Approve this,3
DataCenter,"Glassdoor has an interview question section. Most questions I was asked where taken from there.

The interviews are broken into 3 different types
1. Operating systems and hardware
2. Networking

Good Luck!",9
DataCenter,See I had the moon as the jump box to manage the planet.,1
DataCenter,"We cannot use just any chemical element. So a lot of the planet will not process data and not create heat. I like this match. There is only so much solar power on the front and heat radiation on the back. If we aim for low temperatures, a lot of trash will be solid. Maybe have huge wheels to transport heat to the surface, while we keep the data center in bunkers. With a solid core like on Mars we can mine the whole planet.

DataCenter,"Literally all of the big players are, AI is super expensive right now so the drive to reduce infrastructure costs is very large",1
DataCenter,"As someone else has said, immersion cooling is the logical next step after liquid, and many leading server companies are already selling these solutions. For example Gigabyte has case studies for both single-phase and two-phase immersion, take a look:
Single-phase: www.gigabyte.com/Article/japanese-telco-leader-kddi-invents-immersion-cooling-small-data-center-with-gigabyte?lan=en
Two-phase: www.gigabyte.com/Article/semiconductor-giant-selects-gigabyte-s-two-phase-immersion-cooling-solution?lan=en


Now, if you mean something other than liquid or immersion, I don't think such a thing exists. I know many data centers are now also adding rear door heat exchangers (RDHx) to air-cooled racks but that's still not as effective as liquid or immersion. ",2
DataCenter,"Yes, lots of activities here. Take a gander at immersion cooling, both single and two-phase. Lots of work being done on direct liquid cooling with cold plates, even some two-phase coolant ideas as well.

The future beyond terribly inefficient air cooling is liquid cooling. The ""future"" solution that IBM understood 50 years ago. Amazing that it took x86 compute this long to figure out what mainframes were doing multiple generations ago.

We actually cared and made sure we had every spare part in every location we said we would. Nobody does that anymore. It's a game of averages now. The company I worked for sold to PE, which rolled up a bunch of other TPMs into one big hot mess.

Strictly from an AE position's perspective, the margins are insane. They're basically selling insurance. They're collecting MRR on 1000s of devices under support with little to no failures. It can be a great opportunity if you can build a book of business. There are hardware sales and professional services to be sold as well.

Feel free to PM me. I know the industry. I know all the players.",1
DataCenter,"Very slow rotation rate so that overnight batch jobs would finish by morning (yes, that used to be a thing before global systems)",2
DataCenter,"What about RMA? 

Anyway, as I understand, TPM is what I call ""partner support"". The problem: it is usually risky.
- Level1/2 support, general questions could be handled by TPM (usually, cheaper support fee)
- but what if they run into some bug or deeper issue where vendor business unit is needed?
- they need to open a vendor case
- but vendor sees that it is a ""partner supported"" thing 
- and it usually results in a penalty in the partners discount / rebate level
- since there is basicly no revenue for the vendor if a customer choose ""partner support""

I know and personally worked with system integrators where Head of Sales or even CTO explicitly permitted the opening of a vendor case for that reason. and expected bullshitting towards the customer for their money, instead of getting an official vendor statement (which would result in a penalty for them). 

For a short term, I also worked for a local SMB where easy money is made with TPM contracts, but we are expected to bullshit/lie to customer (""we opened a vendor case"", etc.) if we could not solve a support request. 

This kind of ""sales gambling"" could be fine in SOHO/SMB (where managers do not even think about this risk), where the lower fee of a TPM worth it, if their IT infra is not business critical or revenue is not directly impacted.

But no one wants to take the risk of a middle-man (with unknown business motivations and confusing backend procedures, while acting as SPOC towards vendor) in business critical, high-availability environments. 

Even if we (operating 4 own datacenter) are partnering with TPM, it is mostly for consulting purpose. Out most critical components are always expected to have direct vendor support with highest possible SLA available.",1

DataCenter,"70% limit yes hence why wind curtailment procedures kick in before. As I said this is related to CHP facilities.

Dispatched Data centres can only free up demand by running on their generators, if grid margins get tight and a few reputable DC actually do have some of their dubs participating. Again, demand response (DSU) only happens when margins are tight or an amber alert gets issued. 

Some Dubs use their UPS systems in colos for frequency response (DS3) where events usually last a few seconds only. Mainly for fast five, FFR, POR ... etc.

Newly planned DCs have actually an easier life getting a grid connection when they enroll in such flexibility services like DS3 or DSU. (Demand Response)",2
DataCenter,That makes more sense but isn’t at all applicable to data centres. Also pretty sure the SNSP limit has been 70% for the last couple of years,1
DataCenter,"Apologies, this pertains to Combined Heat and Power plants (CHPs), which are extensively utilized by pharmaceutical companies for continuous operation. When System Non-Synchronous Penetration (SNSP) levels exceed 60%, dispatches are issued to deactivate CHPs to absorb surplus grid energy resulting from elevated wind conditions. A deactivated CHP does not emit CO2. This way, companies with CHPs can earn extra CO2 certificates on top of that. This is often referred to wind curtailment procedures. Hope this makes sense now.",1

DataCenter,A/Es and DC builders ? Not familiar with this abbreviation!!,1
DataCenter,"Does clean power matter if the entire planet is the data center? If we turned Mars into a giant computer, who cares how dirty the power is that powers it? People in here are talking about cosmic rays, but you could just build the entire thing a couple feet into the ground and you wouldn't have to worry about the sun's rays. 

I would probably have some sort of geo thermo energy that pulls energy from the planet's hot core. Your heat sink would just be the cold AF atmosphere.",2
DataCenter,Was it a good sign? How’d it go?,1
DataCenter,Is your PE in HVAC and refrigeration?  You should also target A/Es and DC builders.,1
DataCenter,"At that scale power, cooling, and sheer volume of data would be a massive. Renewable power generation is probably impossible just due to the size difference: on Earth 1 MW of solar or wind is much larger than 1 MW of compute, and scaling up natural conditions to constant hurricane winds or similar doesn’t bode well for the datacenter lasting very long. Let’s assume we have nuclear or fusion available.

To build a planetary surface-sized datacenter, your best bet is probably a pair of tidally locked planets: you could run a space elevator directly from one to the other to carry spare material and hardwired connectivity. You’ll want an atmosphere with minimal greenhouse gasses to enable radiative cooling, and latency from one side of the planet to the other is a problem but that isn’t too different from geodistributed datacenters today.


However if you want a planet volume- or mass-sized datacenter cooling is much more complicated. The earth produces about 47 TW of thermal energy with a volume of 1 trillion km^3, or a tiny 47 W/km^3, and yet a large portion is molten. Datacenter consume 100s of MW in a far smaller volume; even with immersion cooling on an ocean planet you simply can’t remove heat fast enough. At this scale, you’re probably better off using a Dyson Swarm for more surface area. Latency will be an even greater concern, but you’ll be able to spread out your connectivity better too",1
DataCenter,"Depends. Do you need people to access it? If so, that changes it significantly. Because it needs to be a good planet for people.

But if you operate it like we do satellites now, it's a lot more flexible.

- Build it on Earth (or a human accessible manufacturing station)
- Launch to other planet
- As equipment dies, just take it offline and ignore it.
- Send up new modules as needed to replace failing modules.

If you do that, then you only need three things - power, a way to get rid of waste heat, and protection from cosmic rays. 

Power is easy - the star. (if we have the resources to build a data center on another planet, giant solar power plants should be easy). Alternatively, fusion power plants (again, we are already building data centers on other planets. We have probably figured out fusion)

Cosmic rays? You need a magnetosphere, or maybe lots and lots of matter. So perhaps if the planet doesn't have a magnetosphere, you simply build your datacenter way underground.

Waste heat is gonna be hard. The more protection you have from cosmic rays, the less heat you can get rid of. One option would be a giant ocean, letting water dissipate the heat. 

But none of that matters. The biggest blocker for this is going to be network latency. So invent a way to transmit data at faster than the speed of light. Then worry about datacenters.",3
DataCenter,"Not a planet, a small stable star. Massive solar panels orbiting it attached to satellites filled with compute and storage. You’d have to be just far enough away to be able to send wireless signals without too much noise.",1
DataCenter,Some of our DCs used to run their new BUGs twice a year for just load testing a few minutes and that's it. Now they utilise them for grid stability and get paid on top of it. 🤷🏻‍♂️,1
DataCenter,Exactly this. You are able to opt out or have a schedule in place with us which is fine. Its not mandatory to be in 24/7. Load shedding is well used in NA like PJM. EirGrids term is DSU in the Capacity market.,2
DataCenter,"Ah, that makes more sense. 

Like a voluntary load-shedding scheme?",4
DataCenter,"You don't actually provide power to the grid with your backup generators (BUGs); instead, you reduce demand by using sections of your data centers (DUBs) powered by the BUGs.

This occurs when grid margins tighten due to events like a generator trip at Moneypoint combined with low wind generation. Such events, called by EirGrid, typically last no more than 2 hours and usually occur during peak times. 

On average, these events account for 12-16 hours per year. 

Some of our data centers (DCs) have multiple DUBs, with only one to three enrolled in the Demand Side Unit (DSU) service.

Additionally, DCs can provide fast frequency response through their Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS).

This service is fully automated through our equipment, with trigger points below 49.7 Hz, which rarely happens on the grid. These events usually last only a few seconds, but the incentives are substantial. 

Most of our DCs have only a few colocation units enabled, which is sufficient to earn significant incentives.

Most of our DC don't do it for the money but rather be a supportive grid citizen to help the grid if it's needed. The  revenue is just a little plus for them if you know what I mean.",0
DataCenter,No breaking of causality speed limit on this sub!,2
DataCenter,"Data centre customer here. I pay my DC providers in Ireland to be T3 aligned and expect them to have redundant power available 24/7. If they are providing power to the grid, then it's not available for me if there's a grid problem.

I suspect that this is why there's little uptake on this scheme. DC's don't want to commit to providing their generator power twice.

Running on generator power is a common enough experience that our C-level management are picking up on already. I would hate to have them ask if the DC has committed to providing grid power as well.",1

This would also require some kind of technology like quantum teleportartion of information (assuming that is possible) to work.  Otherwise there would be ridiculous latency.  Sending a signal from earth to Mars for instance takes over 4 minutes 1 way.",6

Except for hotspots like northern Virginia, a single datacenter is basically a single AZ. Which means uptime for a single AZ is substantially less than even 99.99%. We’re suppose to expect that a single AZ could drop off the grid any time and build our applications with redundancy.",1
DataCenter,"No you don't. You provide only backup power when it is needed due to a power plant tripping that results in negative grid margins for example. Thats DSU. Balancing Frequency through UPS only lasts usually seconds and no BUGs are needed.

I'll send you a message later and be happy to provide more details for you.

Thanks",1
DataCenter,"It really does sound like a bad advert or scam. That's what we hear all the time due to lack of info or awareness. No offense there. Its a very niche service tbh.

Capacity payments are all year around whether you are dispatched or not. In most cases a dispatch event lasts for 2 hours, where your site switches over to generators. 

You might run your generators 12 -16 times a year for no more than 2 hours per event if an event is called by EirGrid but you still get paid 365/24/7 on your availability/capacity. 

It's like a standby payment that you make yourself available in case margins on the grid are tight.

One example, LEU = 12MWh average gets paid around 80k a month for being available regardless. Your diesel or gas costs are covered + profit on top.

 I know, it sounds like a scam but Eirgrid is paying for that. CM Aggregators get the full payment and work on  splits. Clients usually get 70- 80% of the payments and the DR aggregator keeps the rest for enabling the client through their equipment. Capacity Market, DS3 and Demand Response just work that way in most countries.",3

Rolling blackouts only seem to happen in the hottest part of the day in the hottest cities. Balancing the grid by shutting off feeders. that's a laugh.


Short line transmission? you mean distribution lines or sub transmission lines? Nobody calls them that. it's less than 69kv btw",1
DataCenter,"The point about transmission lines physically sagging is only true for short line transmission, less than 50mi and usually less than 30kv. And even then it’s not usually occurring from heavy electrical load, it’s occurring from high ambient temperature or things like wind and ice. 

Long haul, high voltage transmission lines will never be limited by physical sag, only voltage drop. Usually when you hear people talk about sag on transmission lines, they are referring to the voltage sagging, AKA voltage drop.

Generally, data centers have been procuring power at industrial rates, which can be found on the EIA website. However, their actual rates can vary based on location and access to grid infrastructure, with some receiving premiums or discounts. 

For data centers with their own power infrastructure, like substations, transformers, and switchgear, they may be able to secure cheaper transmission power and then step down the voltage themselves.

The EIA website (EIA.gov) is a good starting point to get an idea of industrial power prices.

The big companies are working directly with utility companies to figure that out, but it's a question pretty much all the way up. Right now most places are just choosing to build in areas with low demand and a surplus of power, in the future more power plants will need to be built. The FAANG companies are buying up enormous amounts of power equipment right now to ensure they'll be able to build what they need to.

Renewables aren't generally relied on for datacenters as they're not as reliable as fossil fuels/nuclear. For many places it's looking like nuclear is going to be the solution, but nuclear takes a very long time to build. 

My datacenter for example is powered almost exclusively by nuclear/coal. But when we built it we built and donated an entire solar farm equal to our capacity to the local city metro to offset our carbon footprint",5

See I come from an industrial maintenance background and IT and general construction like I did all these jobs so my skill set is well suited for the DCEO tech because we don't have a lot of IT that we have to do.

DataCenter,"No a Navy veteran (Army vet), but as a hiring manager have employed many Nukes and non-Nuke technicians.  One of my favorite hires was a Technician off a carrier and not from a submarine.  The vet joined as a facility technician and was always reliable, consumed and retained knowledge, understood the requirement of time in service leading to promotion and greater responsibility, and constantly available to support when unplanned events occurred.

You should not worry about the transition and any job description requirement of prior data center experience.  Your level of mission critical awareness, comprehension of task, situational awareness, and current technical aptitude are far more than enough.  A good manager is going to teach you the intricacies of your building regardless of prior data center experience.  So go forth confidently and apply for every job you find interesting.",5
DataCenter,"I'm a college grad that works in commercial nuclear operations. The vast majority of my peers are from 1 of 2 backgrounds > Bachelor of Science or Ex-Navy Nuclear.

In critical facility careers like Commercial Nuclear and Data Centers. The navy Nuclear background has already done a LOT of pre-screening for employers. These people have to do very well on the ASVAB, do well in power school, do well in nuke school, and then get qualified. So these people are definitely ""above average intelligence"" and many would be more than capable of a B.S. or higher level degree if they chose to pursue or apply themselves in that way. 

So now they have real-world experience monitoring, troubleshooting, and repairing high energy and/or important systems. 

I personally like the salty/spicy personality that tends to come with this group of degenerates and have truly enjoyed working with them over the last 15+years. 

I can fit in well with both the engineers and the ex-navy types and that makes work more fun and enjoyable as they're all competent at their jobs. A perk of the ex-military guys is they'll help apply pressure to the peers who aren't pulling their weight.

Overall, it's absolutely a great funnel for employment candidates that's done a LOT of pre-screening already by the design of the program.",1

DataCenter,This is a well written response that includes many things I also noticed.,4
DataCenter,"To be very blunt, and I'm not attacking you, here are thoughts that pop up based on my interviewing experience:


Lots of this reads as filler when I read it over. I don't believe you need to define what TCP does, and why it's integrated, as ⅓ of the space of your TCP monitoring suite.

Was this suite something you wrote? Was it to help you understand TCP and the network stack? If so, why did you go this route instead of understand and learning Wireshark and nmap? Industry standard utilities. 

You have python and PowerShell as a skill. To what level? How much experience? 

Your certifications formatting includes a ton of whitespace. Move those dates over and now you have more space.

“Software and hardware diagnostics” – I hope so, you have 8+ years of doing those roles.

Skills - Networking. People Networking? Computer networking? Do you know your routing protocols? How about ospf or bgp? Have you done router and firewall configuration and management?

Define what technical support is.

Is Windows and office even something worth noting these day?

“First responder of 2024 cloud strike outage.” Cut that out, and just leave the “designed and implemented…….” Line. Now when you get interviewed, discuss cloud strike.

What education/experience do you have in network security analysis?

“IT Technician tier 3” does not need the company name in the bullet points if you have it in the section title.

What's been your largest challenge? How did you handle it? What do you aspire to do?",2

For the other two it'd be best to get some experience. Every industrial environment is going to have I&C guys, most modern ones are going to have automation/controls roles. If you're competent with PLC's you're in pretty high demand there.",1

Sadly most of the hiring done right now is through recruiters on  linked in, because they generally have a direct line to the hiring manager.

Resume, you are now at a level where you need to have accomplishments and deliverables in your resume. Combine that with resumes custom made for each job. This can be accomplished by job scan, it will help with key words and identify ways you can improve. It inputs the job listing and compares it to your resume and the words used... Most big co.panies use ATS software that scans for key wires and qualifications. 

Keep track of the business impact you have at your company... Things you did above and beyond, did you take a class to learn more than most? Make YouTube videos or something ain conjunction with a GitHub as a repository for what YOU bring to the table. You processed xxx number of server xxxxx 's, you improved #### of ___. By doing that you saved (time, money, built client trust?) this story built in is what tella the manager ...you are the guy. They need to know how you can help their business... Tell that story.

Your resume is is doesn't say you have to be in my interview pool. The resume is the appetizer, the thing that makes me want to take time that I really don't have budgeted to admire your GitHub or linked in page to find out more. In the resume I need to know the business impact you have had and what your going to bring to my team that is better than everyone else.

DataCenter,"Haha, yeah been trying to hack the Gibson for years!

Sounds like your scheduler is pretty smart.  Just checked out netbox, they have a public demo that's easy to access.

Schematix diagrams can act like a front end to a monitoring or data logging system by rendering a  dependency map which then pulls in charts from the monitoring system, so you can see those charts in the context of the diagram.

Also, a monitoring system could also ask Schematix for more information about  an observed failure state, and Schematix could determine the severity, who to notify, and even suggest how/what to troubleshoot.  That way you or other interested parties can quickly see the impact.

I'll be making some videos of that stuff soon.

Don't be surprised if I do take you up on the DM offer.

Thanks for the insight, much appreciated!",1
DataCenter,Totally depends where in NYC. Down to the neighborhood. Too big and complex to determine much without this info.,1
DataCenter,"For starters, you'll have get more feedback on /r/resumes simply because they have a more active populace. Won't be as industry specific as us though ;)

First impression, it's thin. Could be the formatting, but it looks like there's a lot of whitespace. Keeping it brief is nice, but you want to provide enough information that someone reading it says ""huh, that's interesting"" and makes a note to give you a call. Now, onto the specifics:

For your T2 position, you worked 7yrs with only 3 things to mention, and all are worded to sound really basic. Put more effort into this section. In those years were you ever someones 'savior'? Was your specific input/insight/observation ever critical to some issue being resolved? Did you ever work on a change control that didn't go according to plan? 

Your T3 description is better, but lacks real accomplishment. Your first four bullets are again, really basic. You should know how to diagnose a PC after working in IT for 8yrs. You should be able to resolve tickets promptly. You should be able to assist your colleagues and VIPs. Etc.

My advice would be to ~~chuck~~ archive this version and spend a few hours thinking back on your career highlights. There has to be something you've done that would distinguish you from other applicants. Find 3-4 projects you worked on, think of the challenges/hardships, and document how you overcame those issues to reach success.",12

DataCenter,You need a very deep understanding of mechanical and electrical theory if you want to build a data center.

DataCenter,You need plenty of power and space. Not something you're going to get unless it was already there.,2
DataCenter,"Sure! That video is cool! Reminds me of 1990's hacker gibson!

We currently just use https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox for a lot of that  planning and inventory/cross-connect/circuit tracking and we have dynamic scheduling built into our cloud stack that shuffles things around to reduce any risk of N+1 on A/B PDUs. Netbox has a powerful api where you can label your systems and do things like query for too much of a particular system type in a single failure zone. 

We operate very cloud-like using our own developed cloud platform, so quite honestly we are extremely lazy and rely on workloads migrating between pods, or failure zones of our facilities/datacenter. We generally don't over-provision circuits and spec out cabinets to maximum peak so that we do not have the possibility of popping breakers when an A side fails. Beyond that, our scheduler maintains power levels through controlling CPU/GPU usage primarily.  

For failures, generally we design everything with BGP Anycast and other mechanisms to a globally/locally routed layer of proxies (Typically IPVS or HAProxy) to ensure if we do lose some section of a datacenter, we do not impact any critical/revenue-facing services. 

All of that said, your priority/dependency mapping is very neat - I could definitely see some usefulness for that. I would absolutely love something like that to track internal software/service dependencies and tie in my prometheus/victoriametrics data and monitoring states.

DataCenter,What are the minimum requirements for these points you posted above? Is there any way of determine these by yourself ? Websites that might show any data about the site?,0
DataCenter,"If you don't mind me asking...

What software do you use to plan out and document such a  large physical deployment?

I ask because I believe the product we have developed is fundamentally different than what we see out there, but we haven't been able to get much attention for DCIM use cases, and I'd love to get some honest, constructive feedback.

Our system is unusual in that it's command driven both for modeling but also interaction.  This allows you to query things topologically (by connections) and visualize the results, or perform simulations to find single points of failure, or calculate power loads at different parts of the network. 

For example, if you knew statistical failure rates of components, our system could estimate the upstream failure rates based on your design and the redundancies you've built in.  

Or we could calculate the actual and maximum power loads you can expect to see at all points of a power supply network. So you can determine a UPS, or breaker can handle the spike when everything tries to reboot at once.

Are these capabilities that are of interest for folks at your scale?  Is this commonly done?

None of the tools I've seen can really do these things since they don't have a ""logical model"" from which to perform simulations or calculations.  They're mostly just asset tools, or visualizers.

If you made it this far... Here's a very simple video of modeling some racks and power systems.

[https://schematix.com/video/racks](https://schematix.com/video/racks)

That doesn't show the simulation I mentioned, but here's the output of a different simulation result, not power systems, but an analysis used to determine the prioritization and lost utiltity of a failing server or vm.  Helps find servers to restore first after a failure like the CrowdStrike incident.

DataCenter,"I work for Amazon, but definitely know of people who work for Microsoft and hate it. I think the specific location I’m at has strong management who step in and lend a hand when needed. I definitely agree with the “move up” aspect of things and am trying to get into some sort of management where it comes to the shipping and recycling part of things. I will say my managers have been great keeping me off the “production line” area and having me work closely with the supply chain department. Unfortunately, it’s not this good everywhere and I’m definitely lucky.",1
DataCenter,"Yeah that rack and stack stuff is grand in your 20s to mid 30s but once you hit late 30s and enter your 40s this stuff becomes a lot harder so you want to be moving up the ranks. I'm 44 now so this job didn't really exist back when I was 24 in 2004. 

I never wanted a management job in Microsoft because I saw the ass licking, ball licking, whatever you want to call it to get into these roles, I wouldn't even call management, Microsoft call them project managers and they can be the most obnoxious knobs known to Man who would rath on their colleagues and stab them in the back to get even a hint of a promotion. Na, not for me that level of corporate bullshit, you got to be a ""special"" sort of person for that type of position. 

Usually it's the useless retards that get higher positions anyway. 

So my advice is if you fit into that culture then best of luck you will fit in real well in the likes of Microsoft, if it's not for you then look out for the small data centre jobs where you will be looking after a cage for a company in Equinix or Digital Realty for example. Currently I landed a nice number taking care of a cage with 18 racks and I am fully remote and go to site only when needed, never hear from management only a once a week meeting and once I don't fuck up and cause an outage no one cares what I do, It's brilliant, there's no way I'd take a managers position in Microsoft and give this up and a lot of people only work in these jobs to boast to others they work for Microsoft and go around with their blue badge still on them when going off site for lunch so everyone can see they work for Microsoft lol.",1
DataCenter,How can I DM you?,1
